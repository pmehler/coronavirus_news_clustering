Tornadoes (potentially strong/long-tracked) and widespread damaging winds are expected to be the primary hazards. #lawx #mswx #alwx #flwx #gawx pic.twitter.com/6EooplLxfb â€” NWS SPC (@NWSSPC) April 9, 2020\nCooler air will rush in behind Thursday's cold front\nA colder and drier air mass will rush in behind the cold front on Thursday.\n\"By Friday, much of the eastern half of the country will be 10 to 20 degrees below normal,\" Hennen says.\nThis will last through week's end.\n\"Morning lows will hover around freezing in portions of the Midwest Friday morning and across the Ohio Valley and Mid-Atlantic Saturday morning,\" the WPC says.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/weather/noreaster-snow-severe-storm-forecast/index.html"}
