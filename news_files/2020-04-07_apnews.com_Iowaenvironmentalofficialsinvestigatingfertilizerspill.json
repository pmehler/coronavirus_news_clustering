Liqui-Grow employees were able to recover about 400 gallons of fertilizer, but the other 2,000 gallons reached an unnamed tributary of Heather Branch Creek. Crews dammed the creek with sandbags and have been using pumps to try to prevent downstream contamination.\nDepartment workers are on site offering advice and testing water samples. Field tests show ammonia levels were high, but there has been no sign of a fish kill.", "url": "https://apnews.com/3ad05181eb9189be519291183d31440f"}
