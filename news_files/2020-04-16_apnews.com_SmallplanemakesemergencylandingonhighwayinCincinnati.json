The plane did not hit any vehicles and eventually came to rest against a concrete barrier, police said.\nOfficers quickly shut down that stretch of the roadway, causing travel delays in the area that were expected to continue through the evening commute.\nIt wasn’t immediately clear where the plane had departed from, but officials said the pilot was headed to Lunken Airport in Cincinnati when he reported a loss of engine power. It’s not yet known what caused the issue.\nThe Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.", "url": "https://apnews.com/ce6c6f51f5dd0c221251187e269aaed9"}
