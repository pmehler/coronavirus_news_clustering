What about the fact it’s possible for a coronavirus test to be inaccurate? And it’s possible for you to contract and spread the virus after you have tested negative.”\nLemon said the head of the White House task force on coronavirus should know that. Then, he broke out a mask of his own to mock Pence’s explanation about being able to “look them in the eye” at the clinic.\n“You see this mask, right? Can you see my eyes?” he asked. “It’s not an eye mask we’re talking about. This is ridiculous.”\nWatch Lemon’s comments below:\nFYI: Don Lemon is kicking Mike Pence's ass tonight. pic.twitter.com/NNpCimFUwW — Mike Gibbs🏳️‍🌈 (@Mikeggibbs) April 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/don-lemon-mike-pence-mask_n_5ea9043dc5b6fb98a2b4caff"}
