One asks about package sales. Those each cover Monday through Saturday. The other two questions ask about liquor by the drink and by the package on Sundays from 12:30 p.m. in the afternoon to 11:30 p.m. at night.\nOnly residents of Cave Spring are eligible to vote in today’s election. Dickinson said there are just over 600 on the active list.\nThe city already allows beer and wine sales by the drink and by the package. A referendum in 2015 that approved Sunday sales drew 269 voters. The last city election, to fill council seats in 2017, was decided by 230 people.\nEarly voting started", "url": "https://apnews.com/bbd92ae2d1c74b50b13d74c988a6928b"}
