David Ige signed a proclamation on Monday that requires residents and visitors who travel between islands to quarantine themselves for 14 days.\nAnyone who violates the mandatory quarantine could face up to $5,000 in fines or a year in prison, if convicted.\nIn this case, quarantined people cannot leave their hotel rooms or receive visitors. People traveling for health care aren't required to quarantine themselves, though they must follow the social distancing measures laid out in a previous supplementary proclamation.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/us/hawaii-self-quarantine-fine-trnd/index.html"}
