The Kansas stay-at-home order doesn’t require people to carry or a letter, identification card, or other paper proving they are allowed to leave their home.\nThe KBI says people who are concerned they are the target of an impersonator should slow down, activate their hazard lights, and call 911 to confirm it is a legitimate law enforcement stop.", "url": "https://apnews.com/b111ce4351ba3dc6e8a01ea93b2e5d21"}
