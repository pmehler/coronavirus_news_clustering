The bonds would be loaned from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Agency, and they would most likely be paid back during a 40-year period at less than 3-percent interest, which is the same rate as the original bonds issued for the project, Luskin said.\nTo read the full story, check out the print or E-edition of Thursday’s Ludington Daily News.", "url": "https://apnews.com/2ab9e85a8d21411da0e9ee8ce543a1c1"}
