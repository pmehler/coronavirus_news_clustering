Bears are awakening in the state, and they’re hungry, which means sometimes they enter residential areas looking for food in human garbage.\nThe Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife said Monday that residents should secure their garbage and recycling, remove and store bird feeders and never leave pet food outdoors. Residents should also clean and store their grills, the department said.\nThere are typically hundreds of conflicts between bears and humans every year in Maine, the department said. They’re more likely when natural foods are scarce and humans leave food sources unsecured.", "url": "https://apnews.com/22cdc652b511aa607a4d72baacfee4e9"}
