(AP) — San Francisco 49ers running back Matt Breida signed his restricted free agent tender worth about $3.3 million on Thursday.\nThe Niners placed the tender on Breida last month that gave them the right to match any contract or get a second-round pick as compensation.\nBreida had 123 carries for 623 yards and one touchdown in 13 games last season. He added 20 catches for 120 yards and a score.\nHe was used sparingly down the stretch with only 17 carries for 46 yards and just 33 offensive snaps in the final three regular-season games and playoffs.\nThe Niners have depth at running back with Raheem Mostert, Tevin Coleman, Jeff Wilson Jr. and Jerick McKinnon also all under contract for 2020.\n___\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "url": "https://apnews.com/f15d5c0262ef1223683b43c0d1cb5ad1"}
