I mean, there’s no question about it,” says @DrSanjayGupta. https://t.co/y1T5tRyJUE pic.twitter.com/g3l7trss6u — Cuomo Prime Time (@CuomoPrimeTime) April 29, 2020\nMSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, meanwhile, called Pence a “coronavirus truther” and a “mask truther.”\n“Forget that he’s the vice president. This is the kind of human that repels me at the supermarket or the Walmart,” she said. “I don’t want to be that close to anybody while we’re still at this phase of a pandemic.”\nWallace said Trump and Pence have “revealed themselves as this wacky combination of conspiracy theorists, quack medical proponents, and truthers.”\n“He either doesn’t believe that the mask is keeping people safe, or he doesn’t think that rule applies to him,” she added.\nCheck out the clip here:\nOthers also chimed in:\nDear @VP Mike Pence: The mask is not to protect you, it’s to protect the patients at the Mayo Clinic. You had no right to violate hospital policy and put others at risk. https://t.co/HFyml3V66A — Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) April 28, 2020\nPence was warned to wear a mask during a tour of the Mayo Clinic and refused. Do he and Trump think they’re invincible or is Pence afraid of Trump? What terrible role models for our nation. https://t.co/xKXWOWHuIt — Barbra Streisand (@BarbraStreisand) April 28, 2020\nDear @Mike_Pence @VP @VPPressSec @SecondLady you should show respect by putting a mask on, because by not doing so you are putting in danger everyone around you Sir!! https://t.co/2tGTWSKPaJ — José Andrés (@chefjoseandres) April 28, 2020\nVP Mike Pence refused to wear a mask today at the Mayo Clinic, even though it’s their policy, he was told it’s their policy, and he potentially endangered every patient in the building, and health care workers, by not wearing one. The arrogance of these people. pic.twitter.com/IXOlO88e9R — John Aravosis 🇺🇸 (@aravosis) April 28, 2020\nIt is a selfish display by @Mike_Pence disregarding @MayoClinic policy by not wearing a mask. As an ER doc, on behalf of the staff with whom I work, I think he owes an apology to every essential worker keeping things going and trying not to get sick. pic.twitter.com/SzRK7BPHfj — Dr. Rob Davidson (@DrRobDavidson) April 28, 2020\nThe Trump administration has treated the pandemic like a PR or political problem, not a public health problem. Pence is modelling behavior against health guidelines in a hospital with a patient. What message does that send? Every signal counts when the stakes are this high. https://t.co/XCJXL17Vdw — Brian Klaas (@brianklaas) April 28, 2020\nThere is only one reason Mike Pence didn't wear a mask today: Because Donald Trump has said he won't wear a mask, and Mike Pence will never do anything that could remotely displease Donald Trump.\nThat Nikki Haley talk must be getting louder in the White House. pic.twitter.com/6rlakVWHcK — Tom Nichols (@RadioFreeTom) April 28, 2020\nSo @VP @Mike_Pence claims he doesn’t need a mask because he tested negative for #coronavirus.\nWHEN was his test? Three days ago?🤦‍♀️ https://t.co/WsesAe4XX4 — Dr. Dena Grayson (@DrDenaGrayson) April 28, 2020\nIt’s not complicated: Mike Pence didn’t wear a mask today because his master didn’t want him to. — Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) April 28, 2020\nMike Pence says he didn't wear a mask during his visit to the Mayo Clinic because he wanted to be able to look healthcare workers in the eye and thank them\nHow does he normally wear his mask? Like a blindfold? — Edward Hardy (@EdwardTHardy) April 28, 2020\nThe @VP says he didn’t wear a mask so we could look health care workers “in the eye” and thank them.\nSomeone needs to tell him he doesn’t have to cover his eyes! — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) April 29, 2020\nHe demonstrates a lack of respect for those around him — Groots (@GretaGroots) April 28, 2020\nObviously it is grossly irresponsible for Mike Pence to make this appearance without a mask, but the Mayo Clinic could also take a stand and say “hey, this is our protocol, and even you, the Vice President, needs to abide by it.” — Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) April 28, 2020\nI’m afraid nothing can undo the harm of portraying the Vice President at Mayo without a mask. — Dr. Daniel Birk, MD (@birkmd) April 28, 2020\nHe isn’t king. You endanger your patients by allowing him to break the rules. It’s irresponsible and disgraceful. — Janet Johnson (@JJohnsonLaw) April 28, 2020\nPence at the Mayo Clinic not wearing a mask is offensive. He's endangering everyone around him plus himself with his arrogant stupidity. https://t.co/BLne7FIX6F — Shannon the Shenanigator (@ShannyGasm) April 28, 2020\nSelfish, he could be exposing other people to whatever he might have, be it cold, etc. — Nada Bakos (@nadabakos) April 28, 2020", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/mike-pence-coronavirus-mask-backlash_n_5ea91f91c5b6123a17644dd7"}
