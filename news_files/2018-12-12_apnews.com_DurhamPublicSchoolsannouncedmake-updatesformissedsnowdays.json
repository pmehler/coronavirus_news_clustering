Year-round schools will make-up the lost time on Monday, Dec. 17.\nThe four small specialty high schools on college calendars will use Tuesday, Dec. 18 as a make-up day.\nThe state’s calendar law requires school districts to provide either 1,025 hours or 185 days of instruction in a school year. Due to the length of the school day, DPS has had some flexibility to avoid using make-up days.\n“Unfortunately, due to losing time to two hurricanes earlier this year, we now have fewer options for making up the time,” said Chip Sudderth, a DPS spokesman. “We’re not able to extend the length of the school year. We’re choosing the best available options for keeping our students in the classroom, especially when we don’t know what the rest of winter may bring.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/3a73c8dd13be01de3b2841e179c8792e"}
