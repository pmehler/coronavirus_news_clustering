The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial in St. Louis late next year, or it could be settled out of court.\nThe city and county of St. Louis and the regional sports complex authority sued the Rams 15 months after owner Stan Kroenke returned his franchise to Los Angeles in early 2016. The Rams had spent 21 years in St. Louis before returning to their hometown for the previous 49 years.\nThe St. Louis parties allege the Rams and the NFL committed fraud and breach of contract while moving the franchise.\n___\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "url": "https://apnews.com/f399ab1d6d8d1649856c83d4964506f4"}
