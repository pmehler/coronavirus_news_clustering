In 2016, trials produced around $5 million in revenue. They will be rescheduled to mesh with the Olympics, which have been pushed into 2021.\nSports Business Daily reported that all the cuts came in divisions that support the 8,000 live events the USATF sanctions each year.\nSiegel made $1.14 million in 2017, according to USATF’s most recent public tax filing.\nThe track federation is one of several American NGBs feeling a squeeze. They are expected to combine to lose more than $121 million in revenue from February to June, according to a survey they filled out last month. USA Rugby has filed for bankruptcy and USA Cycling has been forced into layoffs.", "url": "https://apnews.com/ca70f444b1fc67e42500e0fc0487ae14"}
