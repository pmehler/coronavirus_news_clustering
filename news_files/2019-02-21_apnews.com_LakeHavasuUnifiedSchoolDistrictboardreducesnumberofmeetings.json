She cited poor public attendance and a lack of productivity at the sessions as the reasoning behind what became a unanimous decision.\nHistorically, a board work session is scheduled one week prior to each monthly meeting to which the public is invited. At those open sessions, agenda items were discussed but no action was ever taken. It was agreed that beginning in April, one public meeting per month is sufficient for handling the board’s decision-making process.\nThe March 19 work session prior to the board’s March 21 meeting will occur. Following that, April 16 is the first board meeting that will not have a preceding work session.", "url": "https://apnews.com/eb3c0e73ff5c482aa188e2d9afac1156"}
