It would also be nice if somebody in Washington (DC) had said, 'Here's how we're going to fairly distribute tests, ventilators, protective gear,' instead of left it up to the market,\" he said.\nDoctor did nothing wrong, he says\nLong before the novel coronavirus pandemic, Caplan said, there were people who were poor, didn't have insurance or had enormous co-pays for their insurance, \"but now, people with insurance, people who are middle-class, they find themselves wondering, 'I wonder if the rich are gonna push me aside?' And the answer is: Yes, they can.\"\nWhere government is supposed to be accountable to the people, \"the free market, the invisible hand, doesn't care who it kills, has no ethics,\" he said.\nDr. Jay Gordon, a Santa Monica pediatrician, insists he did nothing wrong by giving his patients tests to take home. In fact, he said, he believes he increased demand -- and thus production -- by selling tests to well-heeled patients.\nJUST WATCHED Tracking and testing the coronavirus Replay More Videos ...

The first 100 sold in 10 minutes, Gordon said. He's donating the profits to charity, he said.\n\"Use them if you have symptoms or if you have a problematic exposure,\" Gordon said he told his patients.\nHe further advised them to hold on to them and not to use them right away, he said.\n$50 test, $600 bill\nDr. David Nazarian is a primary care physician who has a \"concierge\" practice in Beverly Hills offering \"boutique\" or \"executive\" health care to his patients.\n\"We try to provide the best care that we can. It's more of a one-on-one experience where we're there for patients when they need us,\" Nazarian said.\nIn February, when the coronavirus outbreak began making headlines, Nazarian contacted test manufacturers LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics to order Covid-19 test kits for his patients as part of his practice's role in anticipating \"certain factors that may impact health care,\" he said.\nJUST WATCHED CNN reporter on early coronavirus testing: We blew it Replay More Videos ...

He then creates new charts for the patients and schedules follow-up visits once the test results arrive.\nThe total bill, once the results are in, is about $600, he said.\nStates take action amid shortages\nThis all comes as governors across the country are pleading for more test kits for potential Covid-19 patients.\n\"We have a desperate need for the testing kits,\" said Gov.
