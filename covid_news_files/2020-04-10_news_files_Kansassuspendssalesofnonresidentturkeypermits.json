(AP) — Kansas suspended on Friday sales of general nonresident turkey permits to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n“During this unprecedented crisis, we must take every measure possible to protect Kansas lives,” Gov. Laura Kelly said in a news release. “While turkey hunting is largely a solitary activity, the potential for inadvertent spread of COVID-19 due to travel associated with nonresident participation is something we simply cannot risk.”\nThis was initially not an issue because nonresident permit sales were lagging behind last year, when 14,700 nonresident spring turkey permits were issued.\n“However, recently, as opportunities in other states began to diminish, nonresident demand increased at a rate we are no longer comfortable with,” said Brad Loveless, Secretary of the Kansas Department of Wildlife, Parks and Tourism.\nThe governor’s order suspending their sale is effective immediately.\nKansas’ regular turkey season opens April 15.", "url": "https://apnews.com/7159ccb42a10487bd02a07f5434bf53c"}
