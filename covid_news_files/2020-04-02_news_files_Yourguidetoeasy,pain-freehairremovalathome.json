Find all of our coronavirus-related coverage here, and let us know your thoughts here.\nMany of us are now into week three of coronavirus self-quarantine, and there's a large swath of the country staying home and avoiding nonessential businesses. Unfortunately, the closed businesses include many salons and spas, and for those who choose to remove body and facial hair, that can be a problem.\nFortunately, with a few tips from professionals, you can stretch the life of your last wax and even remove hair at home.\nIf you're not sure where to start, Natalie Ismiel, brand ambassador for hair removal brand Nad's, has some advice. \"Always exfoliate first,\" she says. \"A well-timed scrub has plenty of benefits. It removes dead skin cells that block the hair follicle, the cause of undesirable ingrown hair.\"\nExfoliating also boosts circulation, encourages cell regeneration and improves skin tone and appearance.\nLancôme Exfoliating Rose Sugar Scrub ($25; nordstrom.com)\nLancôme Exfoliating Rose Sugar Scrub\nPamper your skin with this warming sugar scrub that can give skin an even, plump tone.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nDove Pomegranate Seeds & Shea Butter Exfoliating Body Polish ($5.99; target.com)\nDove Pomegranate Seeds & Shea Butter Exfoliating Body Polish\nFormulated with one-quarter moisturizing cream, this body polish helps slough away dead, dry skin.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nExfoliKate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment (starting at $24; nordstrom.com)\nExfoliKate Intensive Exfoliating Treatment\nThis cult-classic facial exfoliator is a favorite of beauty editors and delivers smooth, dewy-looking skin with a gentle scrub.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nLa Roche-Posay Ultrafine Exfoliating Scrub ($17.99; target.com)\nLa Roche-Posay Ultrafine Exfoliating Scrub\nThis exfoliating facial cleanser is perfect for sensitive skin and won't scrape or irritate.\nFacial hair\nFor your face, be sure to use products that are recommended for the face, as they're gentler than body treatments.\n\"These formulas are more sensitive to delicate skin,\" says Ismiel. \"Before starting, ensure that the areas are clean and free of makeup, moisturizers and oils. For best results, any facial hair should be at least 2 millimeters long. The hair on the upper lip grows in two directions, so treat it in two sections. Hair on the chin should be removed by pulling the wax strip upward towards the nose.\"\nFlamingo Women's Face Wax Kit ($9.99; target.com)\nFlamingo Women's Face Wax Kit\nThis kit comes with 10 double-sided soft gel wax strips, six soothing post-wax cloths and one roll-on calming serum to help chill out skin after waxing.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nNad's Facial Wax Strips ($4.99; target.com)\nNad's Facial Wax Strips\nJust apply these easy-to-use strips to your upper lip, chin or wherever you want to remove facial hair.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nJoey Healy Grooming Dermablade Trio ($18; amazon.com)\nJoey Healy Grooming Dermablade Trio\nThese high-quality, stainless steel razors remove facial hair and peach fuzz, resulting in smoother skin, better absorption of skin care products and easier makeup application.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nJaponesque Pro Performance Touch Up Razors ($5.99; target.com)\nJaponesque Pro Performance Touch Up Razors\nFor a more affordable facial razor option, this trio from Japonesque comes with protective covers and precision blades that can get right into tiny areas.\nBrows\nFor brows, what you want in a tool is precision.

One important tip from Ismiel? Make sure you can see what you're doing. \"Before waxing, find a position you are comfortable with and gives you good visibility,\" she says.\nShe continues, \"Always work on one small area at a time, starting from the outside and working your way into the more sensitive areas. Leave a small amount of wax at the end of the patch curling up as that will make it easier to remove. Remove by holding the skin taut with one hand and then lift the end of the wax with the fingers of your free hand.\"\nBliss Poetic Waxing Hair Removal Kit ($22.99; target.com)\nBliss Poetic Waxing Hair Removal Kit\nThe famous bright blue of this kit makes it super easy to see where it's been applied, and the chamomile oil makes it gentle for sensitive skin.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nSally Hansen Hair Remover Face and Bikini Wax Kit ($5.29; target.com)\nSally Hansen Hair Remover Face and Bikini Wax Kit\nIsmiel suggests this product, saying \"It's a great salon quality hard wax that is formulated with beeswax to soothe delicate skin.
