Homes often look their best during the holidays, but sellers need to be careful not to overdo it. The most important rule is: Less is more.\nMany sellers like to keep with their personal traditions, but it’s important to remember that your taste might not be same as someone’s else’s. It’s always best to keep it simple. Don’t let your decorating draw attention from the architectural details. Keeping a consistent theme of warm white lights creates a simple elegance that will create an inviting feeling throughout the home. The same is true inside and outside.\nYour goal is to create a cozy, cheerful feeling, where potential buyers want to spend time. Soft, elegant music and a pleasant smell from a candle or cake can do wonders — but again, don’t overdo it.\nThe holiday season brings unpredictable weather conditions. Sellers should make sure the home is always easily and safely accessible. Pathways should be cleared of snow and leaves around the home. If you have a professional snow removal service, ask the team to put your property at the top of their to-do list.\nAlthough the holiday season may not be the most active time of the year for showings, it is imperative to accommodate potential buyers. Anyone out and about for house hunting during the holidays is likely to be highly motivated to buy quickly. Make sure your Realtor is not leaving town for an extended period, or has a partner who can schedule showings.\nWhen marketing your home, consider displaying and sharing spring, summer or fall photos that showcase the property throughout the season — and especially if you have fantastic seasonal views or a shimmering in-ground pool during the summer.\nOne final tip: Make sure to leave the home at a comfortable temperature, and remind your Realtor to leave extra time to prepare the home before buyers arrive for their tour.\nMary Ann Grabel, Douglas Elliman Real Estate, (203) 622-4900 office, (203) 561-5151 cell, maryann.grabel@elliman.com", "url": "https://apnews.com/d98c270575934dda9533c244ba98ead7"}
