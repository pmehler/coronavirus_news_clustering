Just before 10 p.m., the witness called 911 after seeing a man trying to pry open the rear windows of Family Pharmacy of Olyphant, 110 Delaware Ave. Officers found Derrick Michael Lake, 38, 626 E. Lackawanna Ave., walking down Delaware Avenue. They asked why he had an empty nylon bag and three knives. Lake said he does roofing but had not worked in several weeks. The officers then asked why he would carry the items if he hadn’t worked in weeks, but Lake did not have an answer, police said. Lake denied being at the pharmacy, but the witness identified him. He is charged with attempted criminal trespass and remains at Lackawanna County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bail. — FRANK WILKES LESNEFSKY", "url": "https://apnews.com/3992ed215bd041fbac063e52ea1b14fc"}
