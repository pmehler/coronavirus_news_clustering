He graduated from Humboldt State in 1984 with a bachelor’s in Natural Resource Planning and Interpretation.\nBut it all begins to make sense with his degree’s emphasis: marine resources. After working as a marine biology teacher for a few years, Hillenburg got his master’s degree in his other great interest, animation. He would go on to famously combine the two with SpongeBob.\nNearly 250 episodes have aired since the first one on Nickelodeon in 1999, and Hillenburg also wrote two SpongeBob movies, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie in 2004 and The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water in 2015.", "url": "https://apnews.com/d7bd578875de42d79d87fd7e2de48500"}
