It’s the first calf conceived at the Species Survival Center created by the Audubon Nature Institute and San Diego Zoo Global.\nAnd more baby antelope are on their way, including two or three more Eastern bongo, curator Michelle Hatwood said Monday.\nThat’s an excellent sign for a project to create large natural spaces where herds of antelope and giraffe can be comfortable and multiply.\nIn addition to the bongo, Hatwood said, three or four of the center’s sable antelope, two or three eland and a duiker also are probably pregnant. But the bongo are especially exciting, because — though zoos hold about 550 of the Eastern subspecies — only about 100 are left in the wild.\nThe center’s male started acting “frisky” the week he was introduced to the center’s five females, Hatwood said in an interview.", "url": "https://apnews.com/b6c54ee28ba94ac0bae7a51d2f1f4e58"}
