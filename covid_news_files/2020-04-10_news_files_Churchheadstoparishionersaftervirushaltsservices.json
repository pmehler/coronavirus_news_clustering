(AP) — With the coronavirus halting Easter services, a Catholic church in central Kansas is going on the road to reach worshipers.\nThe pastor of St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church will ride on a parade float Sunday through the town of Hoisington, with hymns blaring. The float features a hand-painted wooden replica of the steepled church.\nChurch member Doug Axman says the the float will be driven past all the community’s churches, as well as the activity center, grocery store and and a senior living center, the Great Bend Tribune reports .\nAxman’s father, Paul Axman, spent about 18 months on the float, which appeared last year in Labor Day and holiday parade. He will pull it with his restored 1931 Model A truck along the route two or three times.\n“It will give people a few minutes to have a remembrance of what Easter is all about,” Doug Axman said.\nHe said the response in the community of about 2,700 has been positive.\n“Even though we can’t all get together, we can celebrate and pray for everybody and pray for our nation in this time of need.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/499fc71b9e8c4bb1ff52a9c348e65378"}
