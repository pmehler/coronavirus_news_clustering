(AP) — Vermont Air National Guard pilots are going to continue flying F-35 fighter planes while 50 air guard members are helping the state respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, the guard said Friday.\nCol. David Shevchik, the commander of the 158th Fighter Wing, which flies the jets, said they have a responsibility to meet their federal conversion timeline after switching from the F-16 to the F-35s.\n“We take our state and federal missions very seriously and are taking every precaution to maintain the health of our force during this unprecedented time,” Shevchik said in a statement distributed by the guard.\nVermont Adjutant Gen. Greg Knight said the guard has the responsibility to support Vermont while also maintaining readiness for federal call-ups.\n“We will practice social distancing in all our training to include a virtual drill for at least April,” Knight said.\nThe air guard now has 15 F-35s. By mid-year they will have 20 of the aircraft, which replaced the F-16 fighters the Vermont guard used to fly.\nThe planes will continue with their regular morning and early afternoon takeoffs.", "url": "https://apnews.com/e9196f4a8871b07af72a7c3b33921249"}
