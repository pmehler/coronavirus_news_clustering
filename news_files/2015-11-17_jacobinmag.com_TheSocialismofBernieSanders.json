On the presidential campaign trail, by way of definition, he’s repeatedly pointed to European countries with relatively robust welfare states.\nOn Thursday, in a major campaign address, he turned back stateside. Sanders cast himself not as the heir of Eugene Debs — a portrait of whom hangs in his congressional office — but of Franklin Roosevelt. In short, for Sanders, democratic socialism means New Deal liberalism.\nWhat should socialists of a more radical bent make of such a definition? To what extent is the Sanders campaign good for social forces to his left? And how should we view the foreign policy portion of Sanders’s speech, in which he both criticized US intervention and praised NATO?\nThree Jacobin contributors give their thoughts:", "url": "https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/11/bernie-sanders-socialism-franklin-roosevelt-four-freedoms-economic-bill-rights/"}
