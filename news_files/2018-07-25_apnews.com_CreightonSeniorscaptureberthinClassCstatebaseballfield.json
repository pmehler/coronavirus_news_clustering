Coach (Dan) Murray does a great job with those guys.”\nFor Creighton, though, another difference-maker was the complete-game effort by pitcher Wyatt Diedrichsen — the coach’s son — who limited Neligh to just three hits while striking out six, helping his team overcome four errors during the course of the game.\n“As a dad I’m very proud of him, and as a coach we needed to turn to him today, and he needed to come through with a big performance for us,” Coach Diedrichsen said. “He throws a lot of off-speed stuff, but he still throws hard enough to put it past kids at times. I’m proud of how he performed.”\nBut another area that Creighton excelled was on the base paths, making the most of seven hits — including a pair of doubles, by Bryce Zimmerer and Connor Hammer — to score 11 runs despite a stellar pitching performance by Neligh’s Jayden Arehart.\n“We were able to manufacture a few runs like we wanted to, and we needed to get on the scoreboard,” Diedrichsen said. “Jayden Arehart is a great pitcher, and for us to get some runs on that kid — as hard as he throws and with his nice breaking ball — I was real happy with how we came through with that.”\nCreighton scored three runs in the third inning, taking advantage of a three-base error on a long fly ball to center by Noah Lilly, which became a run when Lilly beat the throw home on Alex Homan’s fielder’s choice. Hammer then moved Homan to second with a sacrifice bunt, setting up another run on Zimmerer’s double to the fence in left center. JD Kuhlman drove in Zimmerer with a soft line drive through the right side of Neligh’s defense, and Creighton led 3-0.\n“We’ve got some speed and we work on (running the bases),” Diedrichsen said. “We talk about our baserunning, doing things right, all the time. We had one bunt we didn’t get down, but other than that I was happy with what the kids did.”\nCreighton scored three more runs in the fifth without a hit, as Arehart struggled momentarily to get the ball across the plate — hitting a batter and walking two more, all of whom scored on an error and a wild pitch — before returning to form and striking out two batters to end the inning.\nBut Creighton’s lead had increased to 6-0 and, although Neligh got a run on a single combined with a Creighton error, a four-run burst in the fifth on three Creighton hits — featuring Hammer’s two-RBI double into the right-center gap — and three walks by Arehart set up Creighton’s opportunity to close out the win with the 10-run rule in the next inning with Lilly’s RBI single to centerfield bringing pinch runner Clay Curtis across the plate for the 11-1 final score.\n“This group of boys includes some who were the state runner-up last year in Juniors; we’ve probably had three runner-up (Senior) teams in the last four or five years,” Diedrichsen said. “We’ve had pretty good success; we’ve got a good thing going, and we’ve put in a lot of time and our kids work awful hard. There’s times that they get a little tired of us coaches, but we stay on them and try to prepare them as good as we can for this.”\nC-1 Area Senior Tournament\nNeligh 0 0 0 0 1 0 — 1 3 4\nCreighton 0 0 3 3 4 1 — 11 7 3\nWP: Wyatt Diedrichsen.
