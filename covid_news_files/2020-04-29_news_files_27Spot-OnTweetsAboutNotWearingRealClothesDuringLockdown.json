It will make you feel better to have some structure, they say.

But it‚Äôs hard to find motivation to do that when our ‚Äúoffices‚Äù are dining room tables and our couches are always close by, beckoning us and our elastic waistbands back into the welcome arms of their warm embrace.\nIf there‚Äôs something to take comfort in (besides stretchy pants) right now, it‚Äôs that we are very much going through this together: The highs, the lows and the leggings.
