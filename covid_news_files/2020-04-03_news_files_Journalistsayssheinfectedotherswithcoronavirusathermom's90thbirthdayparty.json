At the time, the radio host said, she had no idea she'd been infected with coronavirus while covering an outbreak in New Rochelle, New York.\nAlice Stockton-Rossini.\nStockton-Rossini later tested positive for coronavirus, and says she believes she infected people at the party on March 8. Two people have died and six others have tested positive -- all linked to the party, she said.\nThose who tested positive include her parents and her brother-in-law, who's 56 and is on a ventilator at a hospital in New York City, she said. He was not at the party.\n\"I had no idea how quickly this virus would spread. No idea at all,\" she told CNN. \"And it is frightening. And it is sobering. And it's not fun to have to live with the fact that you could make someone extremely sick.\"\nThe party, which was at a church in Long Beach Island, was attended by about 25 of her mother's friends.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/health/birthday-party-coronavirus-victims/index.html"}
