No one was hurt. (See the video post below.)\n“Hey, guys! I’m in my gym right now. I haven’t been in here for, like, six months, because I burned my gym down unfortunately,” she said in the clip. “I had two candles, and yeah, one thing led to another, and I burned it down.”\n“But it could be much worse so I’m grateful,” she wrote in the caption.\nThe pop star then transitioned into a workout involving dumbbells, pushups and yoga.\nTMZ threw water on Spears’ characterization of the fire. The gossip outlet, citing “people in Brit’s world,” said it was told there was a candle incident, but it was “nothing as disastrous” as she described.\nAt least she appears recovered from her broken foot.", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/britney-spears-burned-down-home-gym_n_5eaaa5a7c5b6ac7c6f3830c6"}
