It was UConn’s first game cracking 100 points in 2018-19 after doing so eight times last season.\nThe fifth-ranked Huskies improved to 20-2, including 9-0 in the American Athletic Conference.\nHere’s five takeaways from the win:\nPERFECTION FROM PHEE: Napheesa Collier couldn’t recall the last time she shot 10-for-10 — or better — in a game.\nThe answer? Collier hit all 10 of her attempts from the floor and scored 24 points in a 96-49 rout of Cincinnati on Feb. 7, 2017. A sophomore at the time, Collier would go on to post career-bests in points (20.4 per game) and shooting percentage (67.8 percent).\nCollier matched that feat against ECU, this time posting 21 points. It was the latest in a string of eye-opening performances for the forward, who has been UConn’s most consistent threat during conference play.\nOver the last 10 games, Collier’s averaged 19.4 points and 8.7 rebounds.\nNOW, THAT’S MORE LIKE IT: From a pure execution standpoint, Wednesday’s performance was vintage UConn.\nUConn operated with pinpoint precision on offense, making 45 shots, including 11 3-pointers, on a season-high 35 assists. The Huskies were just as relentless on the defensive end, recording 20 steals — one shy of their program record.\nThe ease with which the Huskies won wasn’t a surprise. ECU isn’t in the same hemisphere as the 11-time national champions. Nevertheless, it had been a while since the Huskies delivered a performance as thorough as this one.\nTURNING UP THE PACE: Katie Lou Samuelson broke out of her slump in a big way, pouring in a season-high 31 points on 9-of-11 shooting.\nWhat was arguably most impressive about Samuelson’s performance was how those points came. The All-American attempted only two 3s (making both), feasting instead on a steady diet of high-percentage shots in transition.\nWhile surveying the Huskies’ statistics in his postgame address, Geno Auriemma joked how Samuelson scoring 27 first-half points on just two 3s was “unheard of back in the day for her.”\nWORKING ON HER CRAFT: Christyn Williams is a natural scorer. The problem is, the freshman guard had gotten away in recent weeks from what she does best.\nWilliams bounced back with 15 points against ECU, cracking double-figures for just the second time in eight games.\nThe key? Well, for one, Williams went back to one of her trademark shots from high school — a stepback jumper.\n“I used to do stepbacks all the time,” she explained.\nSAME OLD, SAME OLD: There are a litany of statistics that speak to UConn’s remarkable run of consistency under Auriemma.\nHere’s one: The Huskies have now won 20 games or more 26 straight seasons.\ndbonjour@ctpost.com; @DougBonjour", "url": "https://apnews.com/351075f952074d428812aa115340702b"}
