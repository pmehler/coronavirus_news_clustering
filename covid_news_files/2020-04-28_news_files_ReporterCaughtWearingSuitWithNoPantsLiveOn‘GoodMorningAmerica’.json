In the beginning of the segment, Reeve’s lower half is covered by a graphic on the lower part of the screen, so he appears to be fully dressed.\nYet, at the end of the segment, Reeve seems to get a bit more comfortable and a part of his thigh becomes visible. At one point, he even moves his leg, which makes his lack of pants pretty obvious.\nScreenshot via “Good Morning America” A hint of thigh.\nWhen the screen shifts to a two-shot of Reeve with the “GMA” anchors, it becomes abundantly clear that he only bothered to dress the top half of his body.\nScreenshot via “Good Morning America” Full thigh in bloom.\nViewers on Twitter immediately began posting screenshots of the potentially relatable moment.\nIs it too much to expect reporters to wear pants?@GMA pic.twitter.com/064cNDsmID — K Prudhomme O'Brien (@prudhommeobrien) April 28, 2020\nAnd it seems that Reeve had a pretty fun time responding to them — claiming in one that he was wearing extremely short shorts and not just underwear.\n😂🤦🏻‍♂️those are shorts I promise — Will Reeve (@ReeveWill) April 28, 2020\nMan the more I look at this the more thigh I see.
