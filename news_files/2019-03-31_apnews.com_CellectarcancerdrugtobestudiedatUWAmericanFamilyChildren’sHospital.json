A phase 1 trial, by UW Carbone Cancer Center, will begin only at UW and later include other children’s hospitals.\nDr. Mario Otto, co-principal investigator and an associate professor of pediatrics at UW-Madison, has found that in the test tube, a fluorescently labeled variant of the drug was concentrated in cancer-cell lines to a much greater extent than in healthy, normal cells, according to a statement. CLR 131 also showed efficacy in several models in which mice were implanted with various pediatric cancers.\nAbout 11,000 children and adolescents are diagnosed with solid tumors, including brain cancers and certain lymphomas, every year in the United States. Despite highly toxic treatments, about 1,600 die from cancer each year.", "url": "https://apnews.com/12aad48317d04aaea7beb44d405382a5"}
