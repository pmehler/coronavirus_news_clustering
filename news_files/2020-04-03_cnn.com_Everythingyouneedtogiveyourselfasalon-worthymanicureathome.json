Not only can doing your own nails be fun, it can also work as a distraction in stressful times like these when self-care is more important than ever.\nWe spoke with Jaclyn Duguay-Gordon, manicurist at Green Tangerine Spa & Salon in Boston, to steer us straight when it comes to DIY nails. Turns out, all it takes is a few simple steps and the right products. Read through and use her tips, and you'll end up with an Insta-worthy manicure that will have everyone who sees you (even just on the 'gram) wondering how you did it.\nGet your old polish off\nNow if you're rocking regular polish, you know that a good polish remover and file is all you need to get the job done. But if you're wearing gel polish and you're stuck at home, Duguay-Gordon has guidance.\n\"If you cannot make it to the salon for a gel removal, the first step is to use a fine-grit nail file to gently rough up the top coat and break the seal,\" she says. \"Then use pure acetone in a glass bowl to soak for three to five minutes. Use a birchwood stick to gently remove the remaining jelly-like substance.\"\nMineral Fusion Nail Polish Remover ($8.22; walmart.com)\nMineral Fusion Nail Polish Remover\nThis acetone-free remover can gently remove regular polish without over-drying nails.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nZoya Remove Plus 3-in-1 Formula ($19.15; walmart.com)\nZoya Remove Plus 3-in-1 Formula\nExcellent for weaker nails, this formula from Zoya conditions nails while removing polish.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nDeborah Lippmann The Stripper ($19; sephora.com)\nDeborah Lippmann The Stripper\nIf you're wearing traditional nail polish, try Lippmann's gassed-up remover, which takes just one swipe to remove the color.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nSephora Crystal Nail File ($10; sephora.com)\nSephora Crystal Nail File\nThe long-lasting crystal file is washable and will gently remove the top layer of your gel.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nIridesi Nail Files and Buffers Washable Emery Boards ($11.99; amazon.com)\nIridesi Nail Files and Buffers Washable Emery Boards\nThis 12-pack of simple emery boards has small grit for precise filing on one side and a coarser on the other for fast filing down.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nOnyx Professional 100% Acetone Glitter & Polish Remover ($4.76; walmart.com)\nOnyx Professional 100% Acetone Glitter & Polish Remover\nFor removing gel polish, soaking your nails in this 100% acetone formula can do the trick.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\nNails Inc.
