Economy\nThe Federal Reserve announced a new $2.3 trillion round of loans that include even more support for small businesses and consumers â€” and, for the first time, for states, cities and municipalities, too. The package includes several new 12-figure lending programs, including 500 billion in loans and $35 billion in credit protection to states, Washington DC, and large counties and cities. The loan package also expands other credit facilities already in place in an effort to provide as much relief and stability to the tumultuous economy as possible. And, the Fed may not be done yet. Economists say the central bank hasn't exhausted potential resources and may contribute even more if needed. Despite the Fed's carte blanche tactics, economists say the US is already in a recession and will remain that way for the first half of the year.\nJUST WATCHED Fed boosts support for small businesses, local governments Replay More Videos ...

OPEC\nRussia and Saudi Arabia have called off their brutal price war and could be headed toward a multinational deal to stabilize the global oil market. A marathon OPEC meeting, conducted over video call, ended in a tentative deal among crude producers that would slash production by 10 million barrels per day in May and June. That's the biggest production cut the world's oil producers have ever agreed to. However, there are some major snags: Mexico says they don't support the agreement, and it can't move forward until the country consents. Also, the deal doesn't make up for how much the world's oil demand has collapsed, and likely wouldn't stem the massive plunge in oil prices. Another round of talks between the Group of 20 is scheduled for Friday.\nJUST WATCHED Oil producers grapple with demand collapse Replay More Videos ...

Election 2020\nDemocrats want to give states more funding for mail-in voting efforts , but President Trump and Congressional Republicans are railing against the idea. Top Democrats want the initiative included in the next coronavirus stimulus package to address the dangers voters face going to the polls in the midst of a pandemic. They want to expand vote by mail and early voting for all states, as well as allow for same-day voter registration across the country. Trump and the GOP have rejected the idea, claiming that mail-in voting would jeopardize the integrity of elections. This impasse could become a major sticking point as Congress negotiates their fourth big-ticket attempt at propping up the national economy.\nJUST WATCHED Cooper calls out Trump's hypocrisy over mail-in voting Replay More Videos ...

Iran\nThe Trump administration wants to block the International Monetary Fund from providing a $5 billion emergency coronavirus relief loan to Iran. US officials believe the money would not actually go towards the country's public health crisis and instead go to, in the words of one State Department official, \"their own pockets and to their terrorist proxies.\" Iran has been devastated by coronavirus, with nearly 4,000 deaths and nearly 65,000 reported cases -- though experts believe the actual statistics could be much higher. The country is also plagued by a weak economy, in part because of US sanctions and a shortage of medical supplies. The US decision to block the aid could create further friction with the European Union, which has already pledged millions in relief to the country.\nJUST WATCHED Iran VP: We think we're in control of Covid-19 Replay More Videos ...
