Both won four events, including two relays.\nSecond Baptist swept six relays and the Division II crowns with 155 points in the girls standings and 118 points in the boys standings. Logos Prep swept Division III, scoring 105 and 107.\nThe top three finishers in every event at the East Regional automatically qualified for the TAPPS state championships, scheduled for Feb. 7-9 at the Mansfield ISD Natatorium. The remaining spots will be filled by call-ups based on times from three regional meets.\nSt. Agnes seeks its third consecutive state championship in Division I. St. Thomas Episcopal aims for its fourth straight girls crown in Division III and seventh in eight years. The Saints swept both titles in 2016, the same year Second Baptistâ€™s boys won the Division II trophy.\nLogos Prep could be a top challenger for either Division III championship with all six relays advancing, four of which won regional gold. Fort Bend Christian sends all six relays to compete in Division II. The Duchesne and Concordia Lutheran girls and St. John XXIII boys project among the top competitors in Division I.\nAUTOMATIC TAPPS STATE QUALIFIERS\nDIVISION I\nGIRLS\nSt. Agnes\nMedley relay, 1st, 1:54.67 (Lilli Metts, Bridget Hibbler, Fernanda Machicao, Rachel Wright)\n200 free relay, 1st, 1:43.61 (Rachel Wright, Hannah Lord, Lilli Metts, Bridget Hibbler)\n400 free relay, 2nd, 3:54.67 (Hannah Lord, Kate Mischlich, Pearson Kurka, Anabelle Conde)\nEmelia Buckalew, 3rd, 100 free, 57.68;
