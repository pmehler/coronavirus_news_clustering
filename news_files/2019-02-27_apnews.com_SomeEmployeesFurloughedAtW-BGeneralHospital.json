Poslock did not provide a specific number of how many hospital-based positions were furloughed but she said the changes affect about 1 percent of the staff. She said none of the employees furloughed are direct caregivers and patient care “will not be impacted by these changes.” “We regularly adjust our staffing based on the number of patients in our care,” Poslock said in a statement. “Our employees are valued for their skills and services and we will continue to evaluate operations and opportunities.” — DENISE ALLABAUGH", "url": "https://apnews.com/e5d14560c6254345a6ec2099252d5094"}
