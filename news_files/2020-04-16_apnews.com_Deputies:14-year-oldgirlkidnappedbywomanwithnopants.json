(AP) — Deputies in Kentucky said a 14-year-old teenage girl escaped after she was kidnapped by a woman who was not wearing any pants.\nThe girl told deputies she was on her way to visit her friend’s house last week when a woman jumped out of the woods and grabbed her, news outlets reported Tuesday. Kimberly Phelps, 50, has since been charged with attempted kidnapping of a minor.\nAccording to the Meade County Sheriff’s Office, Phelps told the girl she had been watching her “for a while” when she kidnapped her. The teen told deputies Phelps tried to take her toward a driveway before she freed herself and fled.\nDeputies said Phelps gave the girl drinking glasses and other items that she had with her when they found her. She told deputies she only approached the girl to give her a hug and a book.\nCourt records show Phelps was charged with disorderly conduct in March for pushing employees at a Walgreens while intoxicated.\nShe has been booked into a county detention center.", "url": "https://apnews.com/eb048582598ccc7ccdf68c2258500394"}
