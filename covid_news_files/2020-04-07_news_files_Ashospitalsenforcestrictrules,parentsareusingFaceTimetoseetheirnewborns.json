As a result, an increasing number of hospitals are banning or limiting visitations to nurseries specializing in the care of ill or premature newborns ‚Äî a demographic that is particularly vulnerable to contracting outside sicknesses. Video chat services like FaceTime have become a lifeline for many families grappling with these changes, giving them a chance to bond with their babies from afar.\nJulianna Grogan, a New York City-based mother who was diagnosed with COVID-19 before the birth of her daughter on April 2, told CNN Business her husband and doula cheered her on during the delivery via FaceTime, as they were not permitted into the room. \"They were watching the whole time,\" she said. \"Luckily, I had a stand with a clip to attach my phone to the bed.\"\nNow recovering alone in her hospital room, both from childbirth and the virus, the nurses at Metropolitan Hospital Center use FaceTime periodically throughout the day so she can see her baby.\nA parent uses the NICU2Home app to see and talk to their newborns in special care nurseries as more hospitals are banning or limiting visitations during the coronavirus crisis.\nSome hospitals have a more formal process in place. At Northwestern Medicine's Prentice Women's Hospital, which now restricts NICU visits to only one parent, an app called Smart NICU2Home allows remote checkins on babies. Parents can receive updates throughout the day on their child's vital signs, including information around their breathing, weight, bowel movements and medications, and access mental health features such as stress-reducing techniques.\n\"As Covid-19 began to spread and hospitals started shutting doors to visitors, we realized this was a tremendous and necessary connection for parents to their new babies,\" said Northwestern pediatrics professor Dr. Craig Garfield, who also works at Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago. Along with Northwestern adjunct professor Dr. Young Seok Lee, they launched the app several years ago for a small group of the sickest babies in the NICU but rolled it out to all families in the special care unit last week.\n\"While it is hard for anyone to have a loved one in the hospital and not be able to visit, new parents are particularly traumatized, as they have been waiting months and months to become mothers and fathers,\" Garfield added.\nMeanwhile, some hospitals have formalized video chat systems already in place. The University of California Davis Medical School's FamilyLink webcam program launched in 2014 as a way to allow parents with newborns who needed long-term hospital assistance to return home to care for their other children or head back to work, allowing them to save maternity and paternity leave for a later time.\nParents receive secure log-in information when their baby is admitted to the NICU. All 49 of its NICU beds are now equipped with Logitech webcams.\nWhile interacting remotely with a newborn may seem impersonal, Dr. Kristin Hoffman of UC Davis said research has shown parents are still effectively able to bond with babies this way, especially when it comes to helping breastfeeding ‚Äî a concern for many families with babies in the NICU. \"From our previous research, we know that families who used FamilyLink were more likely to have a sustained intention to breastfeed ‚Äî breast milk is like medicine, particularly for small babies, and so this finding is very exciting,\" she said.\n@CoombeHospital Just like to say a big thank you to the staff in NICU and a big thanks to Mary √ì Connor for our facetime with our baby girl Harper yesterday it ment the world to us üòä we need to do our part and stay apart ‚ù§Ô∏è Keep safe everyone.
