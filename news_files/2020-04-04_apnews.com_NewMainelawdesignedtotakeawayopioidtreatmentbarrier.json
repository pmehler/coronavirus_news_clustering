Janet Mills signed the change into law on March 18. Democratic Rep. Holly Stover of Boothbay proposed the change. The new law goes into effect on June 16.\nMaine overdose deaths reached a record high level in 2017 with 417, and have remained high since. Stover said residents battling opioid use disorder “deserve immediate access to needed medications just as much as anyone.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/5df5a086942c4109bb0e90736d00a132"}
