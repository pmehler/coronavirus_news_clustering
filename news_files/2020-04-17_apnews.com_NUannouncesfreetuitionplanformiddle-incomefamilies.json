The program takes effect immediately for both new and returning undergraduate students, Carter said.\nThe $5 million program won’t require any additional funding from the state. The system will reallocate money from existing initiatives to fund, officials said.\nThe university system already has a financial aid program that guarantees a tuition-free education for nearly 3,000 students from low-income families. The expanded program is expected to cover another 1,000 students.", "url": "https://apnews.com/bb159e9fa468d0581115f5675fb3f1a8"}
