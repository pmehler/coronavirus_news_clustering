Here, metamorphic rocks of the middle crust, including Precambrian basement as old as 2.6 billion years, are exposed. Buddington will discuss the geology and development of the complex along with glimpses of the poorly-known Precambrian basement history for this part of the North American continent.\nThe lecture is sponsored by the Ellensburg Chapter of the Ice Age Floods Institute.", "url": "https://apnews.com/92bc0af5bc6246c7b2f4f8374b215c47"}
