Vicente Gonzalez and Filemon Vela met with border business leaders at the Lower Rio Grande Valley Development Council in Weslaco.\nParticipants in the panel discussion included Mark Kroll, dean of UTRGV’s Robert C. Vackar College of Business & Entrepreneurship, Sam Vale, owner of the Starr-Camargo Bridge, Barry Patel, Mayor of city of South Padre Island and President of Goldstein Financial, LLC., and Leila Aridi Afas, director of international public policy with Toyota.\nEach took turns testifying on the potential effects a border-adjustment tax or a renegotiation of NAFTA — both of which have been floated by President Donald Trump’s administration — would have on businesses along the border.\nMost seemed to agree that the Valley would suffer tremendously as Mexican nationals account for a large percentage of not just retail sales but also on purchases of real estate.\nCheck back for updates.", "url": "https://apnews.com/3f17abbf99a449129584f128366244ec"}
