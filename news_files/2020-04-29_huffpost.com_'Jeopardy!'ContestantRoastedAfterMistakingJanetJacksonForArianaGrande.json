COME ON, ALWIN. #Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/DtuTTUmGYO — Bradley Stern (@MuuMuse) April 29, 2020\nViewers, many of whom were apparently still reeling from another hilarious mixup earlier in the week when a contestant confused Chaka Khan with Shaka Zulu, were quick to deliver another roasting for the gaffe:\nForget the innocent Chaka Khan slip from last night, this egregious response on tonight’s #Jeopardy is the true blasphemy pic.twitter.com/KUfYSUe1TE — Kevin Fallon (@kpfallon) April 30, 2020\nThey just showed a video of Janet Jackson dancing and this dude said \"who is Ariana Grande?\" #Jeopardy pic.twitter.com/ttOxTZ7hA7 — misSANDeI (@dunn_ryte) April 29, 2020\nAt least one “Jeopardy!” watcher was willing to cut him some slack, though.\nIn my man’s defense, it clip was a wide shot, so maybe he needed a closer look. 😂 Maybe the “Ariana-ish” ponytail threw him off. pic.twitter.com/oNMQAAabAf — Roy Wood Jr- Ex Jedi (@roywoodjr) April 29, 2020", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jeopardy-ariana-grande-janet-jackson-mixup_n_5eaa230ec5b62eaf043eb0e3"}
