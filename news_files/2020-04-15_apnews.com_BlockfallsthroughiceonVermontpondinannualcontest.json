(AP) — A cinder block fell through the ice on Joe’s Pond in West Danville on Wednesday morning, an official sign of spring in northeastern Vermont.\nEach year, people buy tickets to guess when that happens in the Joe’s Pond Ice Out Contest.\nThe block went through the ice disconnecting a clock at 6:07 a.m., Michelle Walker of the Joe’s Pond Association said in an email. The winner with the closest guess had not yet been determined by Wednesday afternoon. The prize is a little less than $4,500, she said.\nThis is the 33rd year of the contest and the ice has gone out earlier in only three years: 2010, 2012, and 2016, she said.\nThe contest was started in the 1980s due to cabin fever. Last year, the ice went out on April 25.", "url": "https://apnews.com/1bcb06a9f7584d7d1e9dd5fe87d50512"}
