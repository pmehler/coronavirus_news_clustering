Then he attempted to shift the blame to a nameless “somebody” from “a long time ago.”\n“There has been so much unnecessary death in this country,” Trump said, adding:\n“It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way. And the whole world is suffering because of it.”\nBased on his comments at another point in the event, Trump was likely referring to China.\n“We are not happy with China,” he said, adding that the spread of the infection could have been “stopped at the source” if Beijing had taken earlier action.\nBut given Trump’s own history and his administration’s delays in acting to slow the spread of the virus, critics were quick to point out that the president could’ve been talking about himself.\nOn Feb. 26, Trump predicted the number of U.S. cases would be “down to close to zero,” and on Feb. 27, he said the infection would disappear “like a miracle.” To date, more than 988,000 Americans have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and at least 50,000 Americans with the virus have died.\nTrump also repeatedly promised tests that didn’t materialize:\nThe buck stops with \"somebody a long time ago\" https://t.co/R84nJHO1OQ — Ezra Klein (@ezraklein) April 27, 2020\nWho’s going to tell him?... https://t.co/1LSNznoO1j — Katie Phang (@KatiePhang) April 27, 2020\n“Somebody a long time ago could have stopped this?”\nWho is he talking about?\nIs it a rare moment or self-reflection or another shot at the Chinese, @BarackObama or “nasty” governors? — David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) April 27, 2020\nSomebody = Trump\nA long time ago = February\nNow. Ask him about bleach. https://t.co/DrDlZt0PZY — Steve Marmel (@Marmel) April 27, 2020\nTrump just punted the blame for coronavirus on \"somebody, a long time ago\" who decided this was going to happen and OK I laughed. — Linette Lopez (@lopezlinette) April 27, 2020\nWhen you’re so lazy & irresponsible you can’t even come up with a specific person or thing to blame for all the “unnecessary death” that you caused, so you just say “somebody a long time ago decided not to do it that way.”\nSomebody. A long time ago. 🤦🏼‍♂️pic.twitter.com/Ah0T2wYI2a — Andrew Wortman (@AmoneyResists) April 27, 2020\nThe buck stops nowhere. https://t.co/XUO9kQnP3T — Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) April 28, 2020\nThe disease “could have been stopped, it could have been stopped a long time ago.
