In a society where profit is valued above all, it’s no wonder the wholesome veneer of Thanksgiving is collapsing under the pressure to exploit workers and reduce life to ridiculous spectacles of consumption.\nOf course, Jacobin isn’t an austerian publication. Millions in the United States and billions around the world deserve more stuff. Stuff to fill their bellies and make their lives easier. Stuff that they themselves created in great abundance with their labor. Stuff that will one day be coupled with new standards of sustainability and solidarity to bring even more joy and substance to life.\nIn the meantime, here we are.\nThe contradictions of producing a socialist publication from within a capitalist society are many. So I suppose we can be forgiven for the temptation to make our own Black Friday sale.\nBut how about this instead? To sustain our good work, we’d appreciate a tax-deductible donation. A gift without strings attached means that every dollar you send in can put to good use right away.", "url": "https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/not-a-black-friday-sale"}
