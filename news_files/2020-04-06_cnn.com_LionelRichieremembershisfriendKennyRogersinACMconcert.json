Not only did we have a hit record, but I found one of the greatest friends I ever had in my whole life. The loss of him is tremendous on my heart,\" said Richie.\n\"We lived so much life together, and tonight I want to celebrate his life. And I want to say to all of his fans: He enjoyed the ride. Let us celebrate his life, his legacy, and more importantly, the music. God bless you, Kenny. God bless your family. I love you very much.\"\nRead More", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/entertainment/lionel-richie-kenny-rogers-acm-concert-trnd/index.html"}
