The deadline to apply for the 2018 growing season is May 1.\nIndustrial hemp is a research pilot program in Wisconsin, approved by the Legislature in November and following similar legislation in place in 31 other states.\nThe federal government approved states conducting research pilot programs for industrial hemp in 2014 as part of the farm bill.\nEven though the industrial hemp program is not drug related, the government is still leery of the tiny amount of THC, marijuana’s active ingredient, in hemp.\nGrowers and processors will have to pass a background check that shows the applicant has no state or federal drug convictions, and plants will be sampled by DATCP inspectors to make sure they don’t contain more than 0.3 percent THC, which is about 10 times less than what’s in marijuana.\nMore information, and the application, can be found on the DATCP website.\n“We know many Wisconsin farmers see a great opportunity here,” said Brian Kuhn, director of the DATCP Bureau of Plant Industry.\n“As we’ve been telling them all along, they need to remember this is a research pilot program, and growers need to know before planting that they have a licensed processor in position to accept their crop,” Kuhn said.\nGrowers will pay a one-time licensing fee of $150 to $1,000, depending on how many acres of industrial hemp is planted. Processors will also need a one-time license at no charge.\nIndustrial hemp has many uses, ranging from rope, textiles and clothing to its grain being used for animal and bird feed.", "url": "https://apnews.com/5584d0acff9f4355b177e60c37aa08b4"}
