Fire officials said about a dozen construction workers were in the 200,000-square-foot at the time of the fire, but all were able to escape safely.\nThe facility, west of Jordan Creek Town Center, had been set to open in the fall.\nWinds gusting up to 45 mph on Monday drove the fire and put neighboring buildings in the area at risk, city Fire Marshal Mike Whitsell said. It took more than two hours for firefighters to get the blaze under control and longer to put it out, Whitsell said.\n“A large amount of the building did end up collapsing, but well over half of the building is still standing,” he said.", "url": "https://apnews.com/b2324332b28e166d776129b1a5fe347a"}
