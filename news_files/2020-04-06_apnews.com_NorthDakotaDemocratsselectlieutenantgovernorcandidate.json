(AP) — North Dakota Democrats on Monday filled out their ticket for statewide officers in the 2020 election when governor candidate Shelley Lenz selected former state lawmaker Ben Vig as her running mate for lieutenant governor.\nVig is a fifth generation farmer near Sharon, in eastern North Dakota. He served in the state House of Representatives from 2006 until 2010 and was a member of agriculture, finance taxation, judiciary, legislative audit fiscal review and long term care committees.\n“I was careful to choose someone who shares our North Dakota values,” said Lenz, a veterinarian and small business owner. “Which means having a deep understanding of our history, our economies, our culture, and our land.”\nVig was unseated in the House by two Republicans in District 23 in 2010. He lost another bid for the House in 2014.\nRepublican Gov. Doug Burgum and Lt. Gov. Brent Sanford announced their reelection campaign in October. The GOP has held every state office in the last decade.", "url": "https://apnews.com/db7d46f5ccf15817d22fef78790eafbe"}
