He was being held without bail at the Lake County Jail, pending a Monday initial hearing.\nThe Schererville boy died Thursday from blunt force trauma to the head and torso/abdomen due to multiple heavy strikes that left him with a ruptured left lung, according to court documents.\nA coroner’s examination showed that the majority of those injuries happened one hour before the boy died, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reported.\nA police officer who saw what appeared to be fresh bite marks and some bruising on the child’s body at a Dyer hospital asked Turnstall about those injuries.\nThe Schererville man replied that he played a “bite game” with the boy and that did that to “calm him down,” according to court documents.\nOnline court records do not list an attorney for Turnstall who could speak on his behalf.", "url": "https://apnews.com/38cdd28e086abb0a45e3a83d8161f74c"}
