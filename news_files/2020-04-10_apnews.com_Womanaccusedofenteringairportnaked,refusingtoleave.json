(AP) — A woman walked into an airport without any clothes on and refused to leave after airline officials told her she couldn’t travel, authorities in Louisiana said.\nMariel Vergara, of Pueblo, Colorado, was naked when she approached the Spirit Airlines ticket counter at Louis Armstrong International Airport last Friday, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported.\nA Jefferson Parish deputy was called, and Vergara, 27, had put on a dress by the time he arrived. But, she was still blocked from traveling because she wasn’t wearing underwear, and her dress didn’t fully cover her private parts, the newspaper reported.\nVergara ignored orders to leave and scuffled with deputies before being arrested on charges including obscenity and battery of a police officer. Additional charges were filed Thursday, including battery of a correctional officer, according to the newspaper.\nIt’s unclear whether Vergara had an attorney who could comment on her behalf.", "url": "https://apnews.com/8e9aa6ad6f7fe708cf0c85a7fd2f00ab"}
