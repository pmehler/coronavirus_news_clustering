(AP) — Two men have been charged with murder in connection with a shooting in Jersey City last week that fatally injured a teenage girl and left a man wounded, authorities announced Wednesday.\nDarby Shirden, 20, and Shaquan Rush, 20, both of Jersey City, are also charged with attempted murder, conspiracy, receiving stolen property and weapons offenses stemming from the April 1 shooting, according to the Hudson County Prosecutor’s Office. It wasn’t known if either man has retained an attorney.\nPolice responding to reports of shots fired on a city street found Stephanie Jacques, 17, and an 18-year-old man who had both been shot in the lower body. Both were treated that night at a hospital and were later released.\nJacques was taken back to the hospital the next day after family members said she collapsed at home, and she was pronounced dead a short time later. The death was due to her gunshot wound, authorities said, and was ruled a homicide.\nAuthorities have not disclosed details about the shooting or a possible motive.", "url": "https://apnews.com/8fae4b7f641d8627c045595bc5c9ad23"}
