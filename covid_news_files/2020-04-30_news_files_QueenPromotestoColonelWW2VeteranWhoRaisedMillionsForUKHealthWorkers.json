Sir Mark Carleton-Smith, made the appointment with the approval of Queen Elizabeth II, hoping that Moore’s “heroic achievement” will inspire the next generation of soldiers.\n“His mature wisdom, no-nonsense attitude and humour in adversity make him an inspirational role model to generations young and old,” the general said in a statement.\nMoore previously held the rank of captain after serving with the Army in Burma and India during World War II, according to The Yorkshire Post.\nThe current commanding officer of the Yorkshire Regiment presented Moore with a letter announcing his promotion at the veteran’s home in the village of Marston Moretaine. Moore is self-isolating there with his family.\nMoore told the BBC he never anticipated his promotion. “I’m still Captain Tom, that’s who I really am, but if people choose to call me Colonel, well, thank you very much,” he told the BBC.\n🎉@captaintommoore has been appointed as the first Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College Harrogate.

When he was 98 years old, Moore suffered a near-fatal fall while emptying his dishwasher at home. His injuries were so severe that his daughters were convinced he was about to die. But with the help of NHS workers, Moore recovered and regained enough strength to return to his active lifestyle.\nTOLGA AKMEN via Getty Images A birthday message for Tom Moore is displayed at Piccadilly Circus in London on Thursday. He turned 100 years old.\nLooking for a way to thank the NHS and support its workers during the pandemic, Moore started his fundraiser with a modest goal ― £1000, or about $1,260. But the campaign quickly exploded in popularity. By Thursday, he had raised £31,763,869, over $40 million.\nThe funds go to NHS Charities Together, which seeks to support the health and emotional well-being of the country’s health care workers. The organization helps distribute wellness packs for hospital workers, sets up hospital break rooms with food and drink, and purchases electronic tablets so patients and staff can keep in touch with loved ones.\nOur Great Hall has been transformed into a sea of 100th birthday cards for Captain Tom.

Wrapped in a blanket and wearing his army medallions, the honorary colonel lifted his arm in recognition as the planes zoomed by.\nHandout via Getty Emma Sohl - Capture the Light Photography via Getty Images Col.

The country’s Royal Mail has issued a special postmark in his honor.\nMoore told the BBC that it was “extraordinary” to be turning 100 with so many people cheering him on.\n“Reaching 100 is quite something. Reaching 100 with such interest in me and huge generosity from the public is very overwhelming,” he said. “People keep saying what I have done is remarkable, however, it’s actually what you have done for me which is remarkable.”", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tom-moore-nhs-100th-birthday_n_5eaaf078c5b633a85446ba37"}
