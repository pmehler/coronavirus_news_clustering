He was outwardly unhappy with his role in the offense and was benched for a game against the Lions after calling out rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster on social media.\nBryant will be a free agent after the 2018 season.\nAny suspension could be for a year or longer for Bryant. On April 27, he said during a news conference that he embraced a “clean slate and fresh start” in Oakland, citing a desire to have a long-term future with the Raiders.", "url": "https://apnews.com/50e64b7d82b84c30b4005ecf5365fa3f"}
