A Suffolk/USA Today Poll, just out, states, “50% of Americans AGREE that Robert Mueller’s investigation is a Witch Hunt.” [MSNBC]” he tweeted. “Very few think it is legit! We will soon find out?”\nDespite this poll finding, 52 percent of Americans said they were still skeptical of the president’s denials of Russian collusion in the 2016 election. This has fallen from 59 percent since December.\nRumors have circulated Mr. Mueller is wrapping up his multiyear investigation, which has led to 34 indictments.\nThe poll was conducted Wednesday through Sunday with 1,000 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.", "url": "https://apnews.com/65de8d73cc7e5275de0f90e62df165fd"}
