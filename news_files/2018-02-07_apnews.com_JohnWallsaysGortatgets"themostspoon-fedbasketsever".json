Great “team” victory! Marcin Gortat🇵🇱 (@MGortat) February 2, 2018\nThe Wizards won their first five games after Wall had to have knee surgery, including against the Raptors on Feb. 1, when eight Wizards players scored in double figures in a 122-119 win.\nNBA Advanced Stats found Wall’s comment about Gortat’s scoring tendencies to be true in this sense: 28.7 percent of the Polish center’s points this year came off assists from Wall, the highest percentage of anyone on the team.\nIt was reported yesterday (before this interview) that Washington was interested in trading Gortat.\nFor what it’s worth, Gortat told reporters Tuesday that that tweet was not meant to be a sarcastic jab about the team’s success in Wall’s absence, and that he thought he had cleared it up privately with Wall already.\n“He felt it was a different way and he came back with that kind of comment,” Gortat said. “So, now we got to ask each other questions who’s attacking who?”\nIn the midst of the melodrama, the Wizards’ winning streak was snapped when they lost 115-102 in Philadelphia. They return home to face the Boston Celtics on Thursday.", "url": "https://apnews.com/6d8e7c4e918a84bb446f38b7a8972dda"}
