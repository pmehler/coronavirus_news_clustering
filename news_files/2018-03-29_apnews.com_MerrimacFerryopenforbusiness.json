It takes about seven minutes to cross the river, the ferry running along three underwater cables.\nFerry service at that location started about 170 years ago. The ferry is owned and operated by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation.\nFor more information, go online to the DOT webpage.", "url": "https://apnews.com/b834cf99d4d2420496eaa4b3df0252b5"}
