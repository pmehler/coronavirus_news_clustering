They are with our field hospitals. We have several field hospitals deployed in New York, in Seattle, in New Orleans and Dallas. And then we provided several hundred more that are pre-positioned and ready to go, particularly with regard to New York City when they're needed,\" Esper told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\nCNN reported last week that despite having committed to transferring 2,000 ventilators in military stocks to the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services to fight the pandemic, the Pentagon had not shipped any of them because the agencies have not asked for them or provided a shipping location, according to the Pentagon's top logistics official.\nEsper, asked by Tapper Sunday how many of the pledged ventilators the department still has in its possession, estimated the Pentagon is \"probably sitting on a few hundred.\"\n\"But we're sitting on them in a sense that they're prepared to ship once they are needed. Once HHS exhausts its stock,\" he said.\nRead More", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/05/politics/pentagon-ventilators-esper-hhs-cnntv/index.html"}
