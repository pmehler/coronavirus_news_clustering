After being benched in favor of Tim Hightower, Ingram responded the next week with his best fantasy outing ever, a 171-yard, two-touchdown demolition of the hapless 49ers.\nAfter Ingram’s second lost fourth-quarter fumble Sunday vs. the Bears — his third lost fumble that should’ve been four in the past three games — he spent New Orleans’ final drive on the sideline, with Alvin Kamara earning the final two clock-killing carries.\nAfterward, Ingram lamented his fumbling marring and nearly squandering a Saints win. “I was super whack today. My teammates savage af n bail me out. I WILL bounce back!,” Ingram tweeted.\nIngram’s buddy, Hightower, retweeted the Saints RB1, adding the following: “I witnessed the bounce back last year vs San Fran... annnnnd the whole 2nd half of season. Blessings bro.”\nSunday Ingram won’t go from facing the NFL’s best run ’D″ to its worst, like the Seahawks to Niners last year. But he’ll go from a stout Chicago front to a Bucs unit that’s allowed five combined rushing touchdowns over the past month, during which opponents lacking Ingram’s dynamic skill set averaged 4.5 yards per carry and reached at least the century mark in four straight games.\nIngram has been on a serious roll even with the fumbles as RB8 overall in his past three games. If his humbling, err, fumbling Sunday helps him find another gear the way it did last season, when Ingram had four top-10 finishes in his final eight games, look out, Bucs. Also, future foes, including vulnerable run defenses, Washington (Week 11), Rams (Week 12) and Atlanta, the Saints’ bookend opponent come fantasy playoffs.\n1.LeSean McCoy, Bills at Jets\n2.Leonard Fournette, Jaguars vs. Bengals\n3.Todd Gurley, Rams at Giants\n4.Kareem Hunt, Chiefs at Cowboys\n5.Lamar Miller, Texans vs. Colts\n6.Mark Ingram, Saints vs. Buccaneers\n7.Doug Martin, Buccaneers at Saints\n8.Adrian Peterson, Cardinals at 49ers\n9.DeMarco Murray, Titans vs. Ravens\n10.Devonta Freeman, Falcons at Panthers\n11.Alfred Morris, Cowboys vs. Chiefs\n12.Darren McFadden, Cowboys vs. Chiefs\n13.Christian McCaffrey, Panthers vs. Falcons\n14.Joe Mixon, Bengals at Jaguars\n15.Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Buccaneers\n16.LeGarrette Blount, Eagles vs. Broncos\n17.Alex Collins, Ravens at Titans\n18.Carlos Hyde, 49ers vs. Cardinals\n19.C.J.
