For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\nUnder the Prepaid Health Care Act of 1974, Hawaii employers are required to provide health care coverage for eligible employees who work 20 hours or more after four consecutive weeks of employment. Furloughed employees generally receive health insurance benefits, but workers who are laid off do not.\nHayashida also urged insurers to grant grace periods for premium payments, work on structured payment plans, waive late fees and penalties, and work with businesses for 60 days after the health emergency has passed.\nKaiser Permanente Insurance Co. said the company will not terminate health coverage for nonpayments through April.\nThe Hawaii Medical Service Association, an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, said it plans to follow Hayashida’s guidance.\nHawaii Dental Service did not announce special arrangements in response to the virus. But many dentists have postponed non-emergency appointments.", "url": "https://apnews.com/a6c7c488d975396a45d2d9803f228a3b"}
