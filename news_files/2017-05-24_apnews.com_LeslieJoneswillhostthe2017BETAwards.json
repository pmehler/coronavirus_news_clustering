Look what I did!’”\nAnd Leslie plans to make her audience “downright laugh” when she takes to the stage because she is “tired” of people being sad and angry, although she doesn’t think it will be possible to avoid commenting on “certain” subjects.\nThe comic - who was targeted by social media trolls and received racist abuse following her appearance in the fantasy film last year - explained: “I am tired of everybody being sad and angry. I want people to just downright laugh. You can’t do the event without touching on certain things, but I’m trying to make it all funny.”\nShe added: “It’s really just about pulling the elephants out of the room and, actually, I’ll make the elephant in the room laugh about it.\n“So my goal for this show is to have a big ’ol nice barbecue, family reunion feel. I just want everyone cracking up. I want everyone leaving that event going, ‘Wait, did they even give awards out? I was too busy laughing.’ ”", "url": "https://apnews.com/1475535f6fe74e1c929ae61271d51443"}
