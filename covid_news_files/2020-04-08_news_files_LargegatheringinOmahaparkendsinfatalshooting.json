The victims were found by officers in the park’s lot and were taken to area hospitals, police said. One of the victims, 18-year-old Waw Gach, later died of his injuries.\nThe two others, a 19-year-old woman and a 17-year-old girl, received injuries not believed to be life-threatening.\nPolice said they had been called about an hour earlier to the park to break up the gathering of about 100 people.\nBoth state and local officials have issued enforceable mandates limiting the number of people who can gather as officials seek to slow the spread of COVID-19.\nPolice did not detail what may have led to the shooting and had not announced any arrests by Wednesday morning.", "url": "https://apnews.com/fc9636990783c3b701e98237b3c1e81c"}
