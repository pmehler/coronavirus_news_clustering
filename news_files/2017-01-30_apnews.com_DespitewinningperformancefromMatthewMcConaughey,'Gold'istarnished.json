It’s simplistic when it should be more complex. It’s sentimental when it should be edgy.\nIt has what feels like three endings, and the final ending might have you steaming. I know I was mad.\nThe first hour starts out promisingly as an adventure, and it has an angle that should resonate on an Oklahoma scale, with McConaughey playing a gold-digger who’s portrayed in much the same way as you’ve ever seen an oil wildcatter portrayed.\nKenny Wells is a third-generation prospector running the family company through ups and downs, with the slick style of a salesman and making deals on gut hunches.\nSpeaking of guts — whoa.\nMcConaughey goes Method actor as a balding, pot-bellied cartoon character, having gained nearly 50 pounds and going in the opposite direction of his weight-loss for his Oscar-winning “Dallas Buyers Club” role.\nKenny is a schemer, and unfortunately running his business into the ground, literally, when he literally dreams up a partnership with a geologist buddy who believes there is a mountain of gold deep in the Indonesian jungle.\nNot since Colin Farrell has there been as intense an effort to turn a foreign actor into a leading-man star as is currently the case with Edgar Ramirez (“Joy,” “The Girl on the Train”), who plays Michael Acosta as the geologist who says he will drill for that gold if Kenny can raise the funds.\nIt’s easy to imagine McConaughey playing the wheeler-dealer, with a smile on his face and a slap on the back for everyone and a real sincerity about his efforts: I feel good about this one, my friends, and I want all of us to get rich, he says and he shows through his actions.\nI like this character, and Kenny is a “character” in every sense of the word.\nThe trouble is that Kenny is the film’s only character that is truly fleshed out, which is disappointing considering the ensemble talents of director Stephen Gaghan (an Oscar-winner for writing “Traffic,” this is his first director job since “Syriana”).\nThat’s bad news for Ramirez, for Dallas Bryce Howard (at least she looks like she’s having fun in the stock girlfriend role opposite McConaughey), Corey Stoll (as an investment-banker shark) and others who live in the main star’s considerable shadow and don’t get to do much.\nThe pace drags in the second hour despite Kenny’s ups and downs, becoming fool’s gold as a kind of “Treasure of the Sierra Madre” meets “Wall Street” that intersects with “American Hustle” with twists.\nIt’s a mess as the script turns into a mix of big-dreams and friendships being changed by big money, the little guy being overrun by people with power, and one man trying to leave a golden legacy.\nMcConaughey can still take home the “Gold,” but his film is out of the running for silver or bronze. Maybe dig for some nickel and copper when it hits the dollar-theater.", "url": "https://apnews.com/dc004d51ba4e416eb8dde7a93257aad2"}
