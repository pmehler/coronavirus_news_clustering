Ever heard of it?\nIf you're like most Americans, the answer to that question is \"no.\" In fact, fully three quarters (76%) of Americans said they had never heard of the broad-scale, internet-based conspiracy group in new Pew polling . One in 5 people said they had heard \"a little\" about the QAnon movement while 3% said they had heard \"a lot.\"\nThose numbers are intriguing to say the least -- mostly because we simply haven't had much (or any) credible polling on how much penetration QAnon had made into mainstream consciousness. The Pew numbers function as a sort of baseline in that regard: Roughly 1 in 4 Americans have even heard of QAnon.\nWhich is, candidly, reassuring, given the conspiracy theories that QAnon embraces.\nLet's start from here: QAnon is based on a belief that there is a high-level government official -- \"Q\" -- who sprinkles clues on internet message boards like 4chan and 8chan about a massive \"deep state\" conspiracy (or series of conspiracies) at work in the country.", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/politics/qanon-pew-poll/index.html"}
