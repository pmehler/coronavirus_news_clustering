The amount of virus given off, though, appeared to decline after people began feeling sick.\nResearchers gave a stark warning alongside their research: Because people may be spreading the virus before they show symptoms, public health interventions -- such as contact tracing -- will need to be adjusted.\nRead More", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/15/health/coronavirus-symptoms-infectious-study/index.html"}
