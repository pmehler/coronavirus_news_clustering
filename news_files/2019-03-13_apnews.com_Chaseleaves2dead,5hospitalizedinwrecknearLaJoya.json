Johnny Hernandez, spokesman for DPS.\nThe agency has yet to release any of their identities.\nThe crash occurred on U.S Highway 83 near Jara Chinas Road after a chase ensued between a DPS trooper and the driver of a Ford Expedition, who was traveling eastbound and failed to stop when the trooper attempted to initiate a traffic stop.\nThe Expedition’s driver lost control of the vehicle during the chase and veered into the median, striking a Nissan traveling westbound, according to DPS.\nThe Expedition’s driver fled into a bushy area on foot and law enforcement is currently looking for him, Hernandez said.\nDPS urges drivers to find alternate routes leading into La Joya because U.S. Highway 83 will be closed for a few hours.", "url": "https://apnews.com/372269e080384ce1a03835af640d010d"}
