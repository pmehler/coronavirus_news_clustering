To avoid another round of flooding, the county should be reducing greenhouse gas emissions, not promoting another way to waste fuel.\nIf you want to slow global warming, join our boycott of the Dane County Airport. At the same time, youâ€™ll be making Madison a healthier and more desirable place to live.
