Lincoln Highway clashed with the proposed Mindful Tattoo owner, which would go in at 625 E. Lincoln Highway, in the former Fargo Theater building.\n“I think that maybe three [tattoo shops] might be a little too much for the size of DeKalb,” said Robert Schaal during a public hearing for Mindful Tattoo. Schaal and his wife, Melissa, are the owners of Out On A Whim.\nCity code allows only two body art establishments in the central business district. Out On A Whim already has one license, and Proton Tattoo, 120 S. Fourth St, has the other. Mindful Tattoo would be owned by Barbara Duncan, who had been a co-owner of Out On A Whim and operated as its business manager. The owners have since fallen out, and squabbled Monday night over licensing intentions, book-keeping and alleged sales tax avoidance.\n“The sales tax that [the city is] due, you’re not getting it, and this is a direct result of the business manager,” said Michael Styles, former accountant for Out On A Whim, who said he resigned because of an “ethical dilemma” after discovering Out on A Whim’s business manager was not accurately reporting monthly and quarterly sales of the business.\n“The cat’s out of the bag, I’m feeling that the city of DeKalb is not getting its sales tax from that business,” 4th Ward Alderman Patrick Fagan said. He expressed his desire for an audit or closer investigation by the city to look into the financial allegations.\n“My client has the current license and fully intends to renew it,” said attorney James Stoddard, of Klein, Stoddard, Buck and Lewis LLC. Stoddard was representing the Schaals. A license renewal application was not turned in early enough to be reviewed at Monday’s meeting. Google currently lists Out On A Whim as “permanently closed.”\nAfter the public hearings for both tattoo shops, City Attorney Dean Frieders suggested council give himself, Stoddard, and Duncan’s attorney a few minutes to “talk this through,” after which Frieders came before council to suggest the issuance of a license be postponed until the Dec. 18 council meeting.\n“At that point in time, we would anticipate returning with a public hearing,” Frieders said, adding the city could explore amending the current ordinance which limits the number of parlors allowed in the Central Business District.\nA third proposed tattoo parlor, Tall Tattoo, at 205 S. Third St., was denied approval for not meeting a city code to be at least 100 feet back from a church, in this case DeKalb Foursquare Church, 209 Grove St., and had a negative recommendation by DeKalb police based on the owner’s criminal history.", "url": "https://apnews.com/4eaa05b1f972480f997f7cc81da51353"}
