Applicants must also have no violations on their record.\n“What the executive order does, it allows the teen driver to go to that next phase without having to take that road test because of social distancing problems, obviously, in trying to provide the test,” Spencer Moore, the commissioner at the Department of Driver Services, told Atlanta station WSB-TV.\nThis new fast-track waiver for teens requires a parent to sign off on the completed 40-hour driving requirement, which has raised some concerns about honesty.\nPgiam via Getty Images Georgians are able to get a driver's license online if they already have a learner's permit and have completing 40-hours of supervised training over at least one year.\n“I’m hoping most parents won’t just sign off on those 40 hours,” Stormi Kenney, who owns the Kennesaw Driving School north of Atlanta, told Fox 5 Atlanta. “I’m hoping most will take the time and drive with their kids before they let them obtain their driver’s license.”\nGeorgia, which has already taken some heat over its decision to open large parts of its economy ahead of other states, appears to be the first state to relax such rules for obtaining a license. Other states have simply suspended driving tests amid the pandemic with no exceptions offered for permit holders.\nThis relaxed driving requirement is expected to stay in effect until Georgia’s public health state of emergency is lifted.\nMoore said that the majority of those who have completed the 40-hour driving requirement are ready to hit the road.\n“We see a very high pass rate,” he told WSB-TV, adding that more than 80% pass on their first try.\nCLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to reflect that some of the requirements apply only to teenagers ages 16 to 18.", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/georgia-suspends-drivers-license-road-test_n_5eab2363c5b62aaf4365f47c"}
