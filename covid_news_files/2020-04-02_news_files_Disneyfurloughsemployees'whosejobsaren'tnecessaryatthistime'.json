Its theme parks around the world have shuttered, its cruise line is suspended and many of its biggest films of the year have been delayed . Live sporting events, the lifeblood of the Disney-owned ESPN, have also been suspended. Shares ofhave plummeted more than 30% year to date.\nThe impact is hitting Disney's theme park employees especially hard. All of Disney's twelve theme parks have been shuttered since March 15th , after which the company committed to paying salaries through April 18th.

Among those impacted could be the Disney Parks' storied \"Imagineers\" â€” the designers of the parks, rides and hotels.\nDisney's announcement is one of the signs of the economic destruction rippling through the travel industry, which employs some 319 million workers globally.\nRead More", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/02/business/disney-world-disneyland-furloughs/index.html"}
