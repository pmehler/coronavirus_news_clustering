Hide Caption 132 of 144\nPhotos: Ancient finds Razanandrongobe sakalavae, or \" Razana ,\" was one of the top predators of the Jurassic period in Madagascar 170 million years ago. Although it looks different from modern-day crocodiles and had teeth similar to a T. rex's, Razana was not a dinosaur but a crocodile relative with a deep skull. Hide Caption 133 of 144\nPhotos: Ancient finds An artist's reconstruction shows Macrauchenia patachonica, which roamed South America thousands of years ago. Combining a range of odd characteristics from llamas and camels to rhinos and antelopes, Macrauchenia defied clarification until now and has been added to the tree of life. It belongs to a sister group of Perissodactyla, which includes horses, rhinos and tapirs.

This surprisingly lifelike toe was made to look natural by a skilled artisan who wanted to maintain the aesthetic as well as mobility during the Early Iron Age. It was designed to be worn with sandals, the footwear of choice at the time.

This is 100,000 years older than previously discovered fossils of Homo sapiens that have been securely dated. The fossils, including a partial skull and a lower jaw, belong to five different individuals including three young adults, an adolescent and a child estimated to be 8 years old.

But this recently unveiled 110 million-year-old fossil is the most well-preserved of the armored dinosaurs ever unearthed.

Saccorhytus was a tiny, bag-like sea creature that lived 540 million years ago.

They also discovered that leprosy-causing bacteria have changed little over hundreds of years, possibly explaining the decline in the disease after it peaked in medieval Europe as humans developed resistance. Hide Caption 140 of 144\nPhotos: Ancient finds The discovery of a species that lived 6.6 million years ago in southwestern China suggests that ancient otters had \"wolf-like\" proportions, and weighed roughly 100 Ibs. The creature -- whose skull was excavated in Yunnan province -- would have been twice the size of today's otters. Hide Caption 141 of 144\nPhotos: Ancient finds The tail of a 99-million-year-old dinosaur was found entombed in amber in 2016, an unprecedented discovery that has blown away scientists. The amber adds to fossil evidence that many dinosaurs sported feathers rather than scales.

The discovery was made in 2016. Hide Caption 143 of 144", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/08/world/mysterious-tolkien-ancient-reptile-scn/index.html"}
