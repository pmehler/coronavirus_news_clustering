Monday’s opinion said that it has not been proven that, during the pandemic, such protective equipment would not be used during an examination of a woman seeking a medication abortion.\nNancy Northup, president and chief executive of the nonprofit Center for Reproductive Rights, said the appeals court it “is creating chaos and uncertainty for women seeking abortions in Texas.”\n“Patients who had appointments scheduled will now be thrown into a state of panic yet again,” she said in a statement. “It’s clear this abortion ban has nothing to do with the pandemic. Texas has been trying to restrict abortion for decades and this is part of that larger strategy.”", "url": "https://apnews.com/15be1c06445e2d4c9cf7b3e58fa93d15"}
