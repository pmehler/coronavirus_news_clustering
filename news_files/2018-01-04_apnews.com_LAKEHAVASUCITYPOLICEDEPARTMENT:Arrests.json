McAuliffe was involved in a non-injury traffic accident at the intersection of Palo Verde Boulevard and State Route 95, and responding officers allegedly observed the suspect to be visibly intoxicated. Officers asked McAuliffe to submit to a series of field sobriety tests, which she allegedly refused.\nOfficers further learned McAuliffe had been driving with a suspended license, and that the registration tag on her license plate didn’t match her own. McAuliffe allegedly told officers she received the tag in the mail, believed that it was hers, and placed it on her vehicle. McAuliffe was arrested at the scene, and was administered a breath test at Lake Havasu City Jail. McAuliffe’s blood-alcohol concentration read as 0.178, according to the police report.", "url": "https://apnews.com/2a56d9312c474b68b64c3831a366d8ac"}
