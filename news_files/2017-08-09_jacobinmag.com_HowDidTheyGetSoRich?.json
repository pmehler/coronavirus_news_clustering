Capital refers to income received from owning assets: dividends from stock, interest from debt, and rents from real estate. Labor refers to income received from working: salaries and wages. What this decomposition shows is that the majority of income gains for the top 1 percent came from capital rather than labor. In fact, all top 1 percent income growth after 2000 came from capital.\nThese data underscore the point I made earlier this week: if we care about inequality, we must confront capital.", "url": "https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/08/wealth-inequality-capital-new-york-times"}
