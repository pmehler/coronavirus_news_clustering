Prior to the Michigan job he was the head coach at San Diego State (13-12 record) and Ball State (34-38), his alma mater.\nAlso Monday, the Panthers said they will interview Marty Hurney, Jimmy Raye III and Lake Dawson for the team’s general manager position.\nHurney is currently the Panthers interim GM, but his contract expires June 30.", "url": "https://apnews.com/3cb40843e6e440f28cc634e988365c1b"}
