This tax on business personal property is one of the most onerous and unfair taxes my business must deal with.\nFirst, I pay sales tax to the county on all of my business equipment and furnishings and then every year I pay on the depreciated value of those very same pieces of equipment and furnishings.\nDouble taxation is bad enough, but the annual tracking and reporting is even worse.\nOver the years there have been more and more exemptions to the personal property laws. It’s been studied and tweaked. But now it’s time to fully eliminate this tax on business.\nMy vote goes to Raul Labrador who as Governor will work with the business community, counties and the legislature to finally get the personal property tax eliminated.\nCasey Minshew, Meridian", "url": "https://apnews.com/3849109f65c1453b9917cd7c196a84ca"}
