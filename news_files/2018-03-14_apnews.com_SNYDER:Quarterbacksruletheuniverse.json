QBs are the most scrutinized and criticized, but that’s a small price to pay for the prestige and extensive package of off-field benefits.\nBut as good as life has been, NFL quarterbacks have never had it better than now.\nFrom the rulebook to their checkbooks, everything is trending in signal-callers’ favor.\nThe league for years has tilted toward offense, especially passers. Their receivers are freer to move about the field. Offensive linemen have more leeway in providing protection. Pass rushers are restricted in how and when they can deliver hits in the pocket.\nQBs play what’s commonly referred to as “The Most Important Position in Sports,” which can lead teams to go a little crazy. For instance, Chicago signed Mike Glennon to a three-year, $45 million deal last year. That’s one of the best examples of overpaying a purely pedestrian passer.\nSince NFL teams have all the leverage in contracts, the Bears plan to release Glennon this week after paying him “just” $18.5 million. (He went 1-3 in four starts before being replaced by rookie Mitchell Trubisky.) Glennon is expected to join Arizona and back up the oft-injured Sam Bradford, who played only two games last season but reportedly will get a one-year, $20 million contract with $15 million guaranteed.\nIf QBs thought they had it great before this week, they’re right.\nBut their collective situation could reach a whole new level moving forward.\nKirk Cousins reportedly is set to sign a three-year deal for $84 million from Minnesota. But this isn’t the typical NFL contract where a player ultimately might receive two-thirds or less of the total deal.\nCousins might as well be a baseball or basketball player because he’s being paid like those in MLB and the NBA. Under his contract, $84 million means $84 million as soon as he signs, period regardless of health, performance or a change-of-heart from management.\nAccording to Spotrac, Cousins’ guaranteed money at signing exceeds the next-highest amount in NFL history (Detroit QB Matthew Stafford) by $24 million.\n“Kirk Cousins is a hero for all the young players that will follow after him,” Seattle wideout Doug Baldwin tweeted Tuesday. “Now we need more players to bet on themselves until fully guaranteed contracts are the norm and not the exception.”\nBaldwin plays the wrong position to enjoy the full Cousins-effect.\nBut you know Aaron Rodgers and Matt Ryan will have Cousins’ deal in mind when they sit down to negotiate upcoming extensions. Their talks will occur at an opportune time, as the three biggest 2018 QB salaries before this week belonged to Stafford, Jimmy Garoppolo and Derek Carr players who signed within the past year.\nUnfortunately for linemen, running backs, receivers, defensive backs, and linebackers, they’re no match for NFL teams’ obsession with quarterbacks.\nLast season’s results will only increase the demand for players under center, at every stage of their development.\nSecond-year pro Carson Wentz was an MVP candidate while leading Philadelphia to an 11-2 record before he suffered a knee injury. That will cause some QB-needy teams to put even more stock in young players who could grow quickly into outstanding performers.\nWentz’s backup, lightly-regarded Nick Foles, proceeded to beat the vaunted New England Patriots and was named Super Bowl MVP. That will cause other QB-needy teams to envision winning with retreads who might be overlooked and undervalued.\nSome teams are employing both approaches.\nThe Jets reportedly are re-signing Josh McCown, adding Teddy Bridgewater and still planning to take a quarterback in the draft. The Broncos reportedly are adding Case Keenum (who led Minnesota to the NFC Championship Game) and looking to draft another QB next month after using a first-round pick on Paxton Lynch in 2016.\nAll eyes will be on Minnesota next season as Cousins attempts to validate his hefty price tag. He will also continue to wager on himself after taking Washington to the cleaners. By signing for just three years, he can hit free agency again as a 32-year-old and nab another fat contract at market prices.\nBy then, $84 million over three years might seem like a bargain.\nYes, it’s always good to be the quarterback, especially with today’s rules and pay scales.\nAnd when one plays his cards just right, it’s great.\nBrooklyn-born and Howard-educated, Deron Snyder writes his award-winning column for The Washington Times on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
