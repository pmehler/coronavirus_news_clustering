Sanders is the longest-serving independent in the history of Congress, but he caucuses with the Democratic Party. Three years ago, he was viewed as a protest candidate from the political fringe. But after an impressive showing against Hillary Clinton, he's now one of the most popular politicians among Democratic voters. Hide Caption 6 of 46\nPhotos: In pictures: The first Democratic debates Buttigieg is seen on a monitor inside the spin room where many members of the media were set up. Buttigieg became South Bend's mayor in 2011 when he was 29 years old. From 2009 to 2017, he was an intelligence officer in the Navy Reserve, and he was deployed to the war in Afghanistan in 2014.

Swalwell, a four-term congressman from California's Bay Area, has made combating gun violence a focus for months, and he said it will be the top focus of his campaign.

It was by far the most direct clash of the first hour. Castro's goal was to poke holes in O'Rourke on immigration â€” an issue that he has used at the center of his political identity. Both candidates are from Texas. O'Rourke is a former congressman from El Paso who rose to Democratic stardom in 2018 while challenging for the US Senate seat held by Ted Cruz. Castro was mayor of San Antonio before he became secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
