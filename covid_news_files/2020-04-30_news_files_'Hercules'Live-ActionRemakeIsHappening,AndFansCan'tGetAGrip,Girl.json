(They are not expected to direct the new film.)\nDave Callaham, the screenwriter for Marvel’s upcoming “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings,” is reportedly writing the script.\nA report from DisInsider first broke the news, adding that the film is “expected to feature songs from the original animated film, with new ones likely being added.”\nThe original cast wasn’t exactly hurting for star power. Tate Donovan voiced Hercules, and James Woods brought a fiery intensity to his character of Hades, the god of the underworld. Danny DeVito, Susan Egan and the late Rip Torn rounded out the cast.\nFans, however, had some other ideas for casting in mind after rumors of the remake began buzzing this week, especially in light of Ariana Grande’s recent performance of “I Won’t Say I’m In Love” during “The Disney Family Singalong.”\nNaturally, fans ran with dream casting the entire film, and many hoped Grande would assume the role of Megara, Hercules’ love interest.\nheard hercules is getting a live action remake and thought i'd drop the only fan cast i care about. the muses.\nkelly rowland, jennifer hudson, keke palmer, coco jones and amber riley. we want dark skinned sisters playing the roles of the muses pic.twitter.com/itGlPrIIq8 — ↺sage☾ (moved from RU3IRIS) (@taeyongjoon) April 30, 2020\nDream Disney live action Hercules cast:\nHercules - Tom Holland\nMeg - Ariana Grande\nHades - Hugh Jackman\nZeus - The Rock\nPhil - Danny DeVito\nMuses - Lizzo, Jennifer Hudson, Normani, Megan Thee Stallion, SZA\nPain & Panic: Billy Eichner and Tituss Burgess pic.twitter.com/mK0ROuSi27 — Sam Stryker (@sbstryker) April 30, 2020\nMy Hercules live action cast:\nMegara:\nAriana Grande\nHercules:\nArmie Hammer (can't think of anyone else😕)\nThe Muses:\nBeyoncé, Amber Riley, Anika Noni Rose, Keke Palmer & Jennifer Hudson.\nSatyr:\nDanny DeVito\nYoung Hercules:\n???\nHades:\nJeff Goldblum/Benedict Cumberbatch pic.twitter.com/9jUz2qNtMp — CJ ⎊ fan account (@GivenchyBeystin) April 30, 2020\nEveryone if they don’t cast Amber Riley as a muse for Hercules pic.twitter.com/Q4H5Nlegnc — Allison the Disney Diva (@Daviesallison1A) April 30, 2020\nOk hear me out, Hercules live action perfect cast: Ariana grande = Megara // Lucas Till & Chris Hemsworth = Hercules // Jim Carrey = Hades // The Rock = Zeus // Emily Blunt = Hera // Lizzo, Beyonce, Tinashe, Jennifer Hudson, Alicia Keys = the muses pic.twitter.com/fmEHxkgs7Q — 𝕻𝖎𝖊𝖗𝖗𝖊 (@Simbatard) April 30, 2020\nDisney is still in a holding pattern with its most recent live-action remake, “Mulan,” which was slated to hit theaters March 27.\nLast month, the studio postponed the release of the tentpole title from director Niki Caron — along with a handful of other films, including “The New Mutants” and “Antlers” — because of the coronavirus pandemic.", "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/hercules-live-action-remake-is-happening-and-fans-cant-get-a-grip-girl_n_5eab317cc5b635cbe76d3331"}
