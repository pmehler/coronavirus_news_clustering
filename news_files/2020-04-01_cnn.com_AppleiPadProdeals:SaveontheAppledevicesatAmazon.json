And actually, Amazon is discounting the 2018 iPad Pro, too, so you have options when it comes to purchasing a new on-sale iPad.\nBoth the 11- and 12.9-inch 2020 iPad Pro are marked right now. The 128GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro just a few dollars off at $996.99, while the price on the 128GB 11-inch model has been slightly reduced from its $799.99 starting price to $793.45. There are also some discounts to be had if you want more storage. Here's the breakdown:\n128GB 11-inch iPad Pro ($793.45, originally $799.99; amazon.com )\n256GB 11-inch iPad Pro ($849.99, originally $899.99; amazon.com )\n512GB 11-inch iPad Pro ($1,047.43, originally $1,099.99; amazon.com )\n128GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro ($996.99, originally $999.99; amazon.com )\n256GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro ($1,051.92, originally $1,099.99; amazon.com )\n512GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro ($1,294, originally $1,299.99; amazon.com)\nThe 2020 models include a faster processor and an improved rear camera with a LiDAR sensor for an premiere augmented reality experience. And while the new camera setup is neat, and the new processor makes it the fastest iPad Pro we've tested, that's where the differences between the two models end.\nThe 2018 iPad Pro is still fast, runs the latest version of iPadOS — it will even work with the upcoming Magic Keyboard for iPad that adds a trackpad — and has a respectable rear-facing camera setup. Sure, you miss out on some speed and a fancy-sounding LiDAR system, but if you never use your iPad's camera, then it doesn't really matter.\nFor the 2018 model, we're seeing discounts on all storage allotments:\n64GB 11-inch 2018 iPad Pro ($674, originally $799; amazon.com )\n512GB 11-inch 2018 iPad Pro ($999.99, originally $1,149; amazon.com )\n1TB 11-inch 2018 iPad Pro ($1,199.99, originally $1,349; amazon.com )\n64GB 12.9-inch 2918 iPad Pro ($899.99, originally $999.99; amazon.com )\n256GB 12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pro ($999.99, originally $1,149.99; amazon.com )\n512GB 12.9-inch iPad Pro ($1,294, originally $1,299.99; amazon.com)\nAnd if you want an iPad Pro with Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity, discounts are available on that, too. A 2018 12.9-inch iPad Pro with 64GB of storage and cellular connectivity is $1,049.98, down from $1,149. Or you can find the 11-inch 2018 iPad Pro with 256GB of storage and cellular for $949.99, marked down from its regular price of $1,099.\n64GB 12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pro with cellular ($1,049.98, originally $1,149; amazon.com )\n256GB 11-inch 2018 iPad Pro with cellular ($949.99, originally $1,099; amazon.com)\nSo, if you don't care about having the latest and fastest device available, the 2018 iPad Pro will suit you just fine — and it'll save you even more money. But if you plan on using an iPad Pro for years to come, it makes sense to spend a little extra cash on the 2020 version.
