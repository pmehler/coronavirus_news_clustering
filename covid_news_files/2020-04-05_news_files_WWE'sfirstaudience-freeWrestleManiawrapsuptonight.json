Officials had deemed it too big for just one night, so for the first time ever, they broke it up into two parts. Also, due to unforeseen circumstances amid the coronavirus outbreak, WWE moved the show to its Orlando training center and made it spectator-free..\nTens of thousands of passionate wrestling fans were expected to fill the Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida. Now, the event is held with only essential personnel present, and viewers tuning in virtually.\n\"Each WrestleMania has its own personality and has been different then the rest,\" Stephanie McMahon , chief brand officer of WWE, said Saturday, to kick off the event. \"Tonight and tomorrow's WrestleMania will be the most different of all.\"\nThanks for the positivity, @StephMcMahon.\nWe are here to entertain YOU.
