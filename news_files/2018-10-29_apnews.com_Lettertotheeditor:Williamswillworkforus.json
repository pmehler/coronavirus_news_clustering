The only thing that see from his campaign is that he stands for attacking anyone in his way. He succeeded in this in the primary against Randy Vulakovich, and he’s trying it again in the race for state Senate against Lindsey Williams.\nWilliams has real positions on things that matter to the people of Pennsylvania. She wants to strengthen public schools, improve access to health care at a time when Republicans are trying to limit such access, and level the playing field between those who work for a living and those who employ them after decades during which wages have been stagnant while those at the top of the economy have reaped all the benefits of increased productivity.\nShaffer calls this socialism, but what Williams is working for would strengthen the best of capitalism. I’ll be voting for Williams so that we will be represented by someone who can work for us and who knows what she stands for.\nRobert J.
