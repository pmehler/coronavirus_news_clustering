ESPN’s Field Yates reported the news first.\nWatson, 37, turned in a career year for the Saints in 2015, racking up 74 catches, 825 yards and six touchdowns, all career highs, before leaving for Baltimore in the offseason as New Orleans decided to sign Coby Fleener.\nThe veteran tight end, a locker room leader and a strong voice in the community, tore his Achilles tendon in his first season with Baltimore, but he bounced back with 61 catches, 522 yards and four receptions for the Ravens last year.\nNew Orleans has been working to address the tight end position in free agency, a spot that Saints coach Sean Payton called a “must” on Tuesday morning at the owner’s meetings.", "url": "https://apnews.com/27ef3dcf7dbd45bfb3cb78fbeb2645ca"}
