He has averaged 10.8 points with 77 3s in 41 games for the Blue Demons.\nDePaul finished with a 16-16 record last season after a 12-1 start.\nCoach Dave Leitao’s contract was extended through the 2023-24 season last week. The Blue Demons have just one winning year since he returned in 2015 for a second stint.\n___\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25", "url": "https://apnews.com/dc112a0b7b4d49b664eb93d3e84d3154"}
