But it didn’t help television ratings.\nThe Nielsen company said the game was seen by a total of 16 million people on TBS, TNT and Tru TV last week. That’s down sharply from the 23 million people who watched North Carolina beat Gonzaga in the 2017 finals, which was telecast on the more high-profile CBS.\nOverall, viewership for the men’s NCAA tourney was off 11 percent from last year.\nEarly exits from some of the sport’s blue blood programs might have held down viewing.\nIt was another good week for ABC’s reboot of “Roseanne,” which attracted 15.4 million viewers for its second week on the air.", "url": "https://apnews.com/598847bb6da6477290748f7f69651773"}
