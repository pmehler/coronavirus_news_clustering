Htoo entered an Alford plea last month to second-degree sexual abuse, lascivious acts with a child and assault with intent to commit sexual abuse. An Alford plea is one in which the defendant does not admit guilty, but acknowledges there is enough evidence to secure a conviction.\nProsecutors say Htoo sexually abused a girl at least four times in 2016 and 2017, when she was 6 or 7 years old.", "url": "https://apnews.com/86f60ade5434211e791e80b694dde9ea"}
