(AP Photo/Alastair Grant)\nPADUA, Italy (AP) — South Africa limited its changes to four for the rugby test against Italy in Padua on Saturday, while bringing uncapped forwards Nizaam Carr and Julian Redelinghuys into the reserves.\nLoosehead prop Trevor Nyakane will mark his 12th test with his first start, Coenie Oosthuizen comes off the bench to replace the injured Jannie du Plessis at tighthead, Teboho Mohoje returns at No. 7, and Johan Goosen was chosen at fullback on Wednesday.\nGoosen has appeared at flyhalf for the Boks in his previous five tests, the last in June against Wales. But coach Heyneke Meyer also saw him as a potential No. 15, and believed his big boot could be handy if it rains on Saturday.\nOtherwise, it’s the same team which beat England 31-28 at Twickenham last weekend, with Meyer prepared to rest only prop Tendai Mtwarira before the European tour closer against Wales in Cardiff next week.\nAlong with Carr and Redelinghuys on the bench are prop Gurthro Steenkamp, lock Lood de Jager, and fullback Willie le Roux.\n“I’m excited to see what these guys can do on Saturday in what will be a stern test against a fired-up Italy,” Meyer said.\n“We planned to make a few shifts for this test, as I’d like to see if these players can make the step up. The guys coming in deserve their opportunities and seeing that we won’t have our overseas-based players available next week against Wales, it made sense to bring a few of them in this week.”\nThe Stormers’ Carr can cover all the loose forward positions, and the Lions’ Redelinghuys was a good scrummager, Meyer added.\nSouth Africa has won all 11 of its matches with Italy, including 44-10 in Durban last year.\nItaly lost narrowly to Argentina at Genoa last Friday.\n___\nSouth Africa: Johan Goosen, JP Pietersen, Jan Serfontein, Jean de Villiers (captain), Bryan Habana, Pat Lambie, Cobus Reinach; Duane Vermeulen, Teboho Mohoje, Marcell Coetzee, Victor Matfield, Eben Etzebeth, Coenie Oosthuizen, Adriaan Strauss, Trevor Nyakane.
