Football? Baseball? Golf fashion?\nWe’ve got it all.\nFor the record, I’m with you Phil Mickelson. As I type this I’m wearing a long sleeved, checkered, stretchy shirt right now.\nIf you didn’t see Phil’s golf fashion faux pas, it’s in “First Call.” So is Giancarlo Stanton getting booed at Yankee Stadium, Shohei Otani’s debut homer and Columbus’ huge comeback.\nI get in depth on why the Penguins think all the familiarity they’ve built up against their Metro Division foes will pay off in the playoffs in my daily column.\nThe daily podcast features former NFL and college scout Matt Williamson.
